- “Worst hotel experience I ever had. Booked this place in advance on hotels.com. When we arrived they said they didn't have any rooms for us. I thought they misunderstood and showed them our reserved room reservation. They said it was all booked and we can leave... At that point I asked for the manager and the "owner" came out. He was even more disrespectful than the person at the front desk and yelled at us to get out. Seriously?!? The fact this place isn't shut down already is a absolute mystery to me. DO NOT GO HERE!!!!”
- “BED BUGS N ROACHES. STAY AWAY!!!. Staff is very nice. The ones I talked to anyways.  Rented a room for two people. Only get ONE TOWEL for two people. Roaches coming out everywhere. NASTY. They said they just got done redoing the rooms. They need to hire better painters. Need to tear it down and start again. I will say i got a refund. But that doesn't help the bites I got from the bed. Doesn't help the thought of having to use the restroom and having roaches crawling on the on the seat. Plus now I have to buy new new stuff because I can't take it home. Wifi sucked. Kept going out every 5 mins. Just all around sucked to stay there. If you spend the night leave your personal things in the car. Heck motel 6 is the same price and way better. Wont ever stay there again.”
- “DO NOT BOOK ROOMS AT THIS PLACE. My boyfriend failed to research and/or check the yelp ratings before he booked and he paid the price. This place is awful. When we arrived we should have just refused to stay there right from the beginning, but wanted to at least look at the room and try to make it work.  Approximately 15 feet from the front door to the room, homeless and other various were sleeping and etc. There was definitely drug use going on and who knows what other illegal activity. I did not feel safe leaving our car parked in the parking lot. Inside the room there were dirty and stained bed linens, holes in the bathroom wall. Everything was extremely dirty and live bugs crawling on the walls. Unacceptable! Honestly I didn't even sit down or touch anything I was worried there could be bed bugs.  About 10-15 minutes later we walked back to the front desk (our room was the furthest from the front desk so involved a bit of a walk) and were informed that they would not refund us the room rate even though we were leaving. This place is disgusting!! I think it should be investigated and/or shut down. Obviously we left and just ate the fee, because there is no way that we could stay at this place. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!”

Charges cant be pressed becuase baby girl is to small to testify ( as stupid as it sounds , that is our justice  system)”

- “The Chase bank at Speedway Blvd and Swan in Tucson AZ is the absolute worst bank that I have dealt with in the last 60 years. Poor service personified and do not listen to sincere helpful customer recommendations. The drive through insists on your identification and does not want to accept cash deposits nor provide rolls of coins and are not polite. The inside cashiers and even assistant managers are not helpful at all to handicapped - example today 7 Dec 2015: I am on oxygen, and since I cannot get service at drive through I went inside without lugging heavy oxygen concentrator, and requested assist mgr assistance and told him I am on oxygen and must get help fast since they had only one teller and 22 people in line. He ignored me and I had to hurry back to my oxygen in car. I am looking for a good local bank. Why not band together against this terrible monster bank.”
- “I have never had an issue with this bank until they put in some fancy atm in their lobby. Now every time I come in to simply get change its a  30 minute wait because they only have 1 teller behind the counter. It was far better without the fancy machine.”
- “The only reason I gave this branch one star is because they don't have a lower rating. My employee picked up her paycheck from the office manager before it was stamped with my (her employer's ) signature. She deposited it with her cell phone.   It was accepted without the proper signature and funds were withdrawn from my business account. Then when Chase saw there was no signature on the check, the funds were removed from my employees account, BUT NEVER RETURNED TO MY BUSINESS ACCOUNT.  We went together to the branch and after waiting an hour we finally spoke with a customer rep who made some calls and attempted to find out where my missing money was. He finally located it and he told me he had expedited its return to my bank. He said it would take 3 - 4 business days. He left for vacation the next day!  After over 7 business days the money was still not back in my business account. I had my bank call Chase to track down my money. The branch manager told my bank rep that she would expedite its return to my account and that it would take 3 - 4 business days. She then left for vacation the next day.  Its been over 4 business days since that call (over 10 days total) and still no check. My bank called back and was told we may get my money re-deposited sometime next week.   These people have no idea what it means to expedite the return of your money. They are very good at leaving you hanging and going on vacation though!  I would not recommend this bank to my worse enemy, ok maybe for my worse enemy I would, but not for any one else. If you care about your money - take it anywhere else but to this branch of Chase bank.  These people are totally incompetent, and then some.  Michael K.

- “My daughter moved in less than a month ago. Turns out her room on the 13th floor is DIRECTLY below the free weights in the gym and there is little to no insulation in ceiling. She is startled by loud bangs of heavy weights for 16 hours a day. The worst part is that although the manager seemed present and helpful during move in week, she has disappeared. I have left messages every day and NO ONE ever returns my calls. (Although the website says they have "office hours" only an answering service takes calls.) My daughter says no one is ever at the front desk. Very disappointed.”
- “I was so excited to go on a tour here and sign a penthouse lease. Family was willing to pay cash upfront for the year. Kathy however the older white lady had absolutely no idea what she was doing when she was giving us a tour. There was no way to look at a penthouse even tho they had availability, they would not allow me to see it, only a room that's similar to it but nothing like it at all. She didn't know what rooms were available, she didn't know how to get to the pool, upon walking in I didn't feel welcomed at all, I felt like more of a hassle with all of the questions I was asking. I called the lease office to get an update and they said a manager will call me tomorrow, the next day goes by I didn't receive a call and called myself, was told the same thing for three days straight, that the manager would call me. I am SOOO glad that I didn't sign with this hell hole, after speaking with some other tenants here I have found out that this place isn't what it used to be and that all the appliances are out of date. Getting maintenance to do anything is a joke. Do yourself a favor and sign with any other high rise, there's 3 others that will be more than happy to accommodate you, after all, you are paying 15k for the year”
- “If I could give Sol Y Luna a 0/5- I would. I lived here for two years in a row, and within the previous year the management has changed and has been a disaster. Upon moving in, my door had dents from punches left, a ripped up couch, paint splattered everywhere, a bolt missing from my balcony, and some brown stain across my bathroom wall- which I believe was mold. Within the past year, understanding with COVID- other apartments had the pool open with accommodations along with the gym, Sol y Luna did not. There was never anyone at the front desk of Sol until around a month ago. MULTIPLE packages have been lost. There has been no security and the doors often open on there own. Not the best at 4am. I had a broken oven for over two months- which would randomly turn on and heat to 400 degrees and above. Now I have had broken air conditioning for a week and a half which the owner does not keep supplies or parts for broken pieces in the apartment. After around my 4th time calling about it, a temporary fan was brought in. I have spoken to the owner David multiple times, as has my mother- in which he proceeded to say chosen words to my roommates about it. For how expensive these apartments are- live somewhere else. Half the time the elevators are broken, the pool has been drained in maintence for weeks now when they said it would be a week. The owner David is no help and could care less about the individuals to live here. I have also been overcharged on utilities multiple times, as well as my roommates, and we have to call every month to correct it. New management ruined Sol.”

- “Worst food place ever been to, these guys need to be fired. Just look at these reviews. How is KFC allowing this?”
- “I don't usually get chicken an if I do it's usually from the grocery stores. But today my gf said she just had to have a KFC famous bowl so of course being the good man I am I come to the nearest location. After waiting in the drive thru in 102 degree weather an still no one has came on the intercom to take my order, I drive around to the window still nobody, I drive around to the door an 2 of the 3 workers are outside smoking. I go inside an make sure they know how long I was waiting. The worker just says it's not his fault they don't have enough staff so they can't work the drive thru. I order my food an they guy proceeds to throw the bowls around like a child would to let you know he is mad. If this place doesn't get better management I will definitely DEFINITELY not be coming here again. Wish I could give less stars!”
- “This is probably the worst of all the KFC locations. They are always out of product and I'm not even talking late at night before closing either. I tried to purchase their chicken pot pie at 12 noon on a Sunday and was told they were out. Another occasion they had those little mini commercials on constantly so I decided to go and purchase a few. But upon ordering during a Sunday afternoon they were out of the buns for the mini's. can't see how this place stays in business.”

## Tips from customers
Mmm love me some original fried chicken! Horrible service. Hardly ever has chicken ready. A 30 minute wait on chicken? Nope! Poor customer service! Does not offer grilled chicken since 2016. Garbage Love the pot pies In need of a raise for the workers they are very helpful The store has made changes getting better I work there Tables were dirty, floor was covered in trash and food. Disgusting location

- “This location had me waiting in line for 30 mins needed help with a lost card. Once I get to the window he Lyell me to call customer service cc they close at 1pm. I told them that I have been waiting for over 30 mins. He cut me off said I'll get my manager. The manager came didn't even ask me what's going on said hey were closing we can't help we been open since 9. So bc I didn't make it in by 9 they couldn't help. Extremely unprofessional I will never use or go to this location again. To see how management was acting it was disgusting experience. I was there 12/14 at 12:15. Pathetic branch”
- “No point in calling or even doing a walk-in if they don't know how to do their own job. Waited on the phone for 40 min to be told they can't do anything.‍”
- “I came here the other day, and waited in line for about 20 minutes in order to replace a stolen debit card, and receive a temporary one.   Unfortunately I came in without my smartphone, and was told that I needed to schedule an appointment with them online, and that they couldn't schedule one at the desk.  In the past, this was never an issue. All I needed to do was show up, and then I would get it replaced. So I guess they changed their policy.   This of course, could have been remedied if there was a greeter there to ask me what type of service I was needing at the moment like they used to.    This is the type of crappy customer service that makes me want to leave Bank of America. The only reason why I am still there is because I travel a lot and they are located everywhere.”

- “NEGATIVE stars if it was an option. Do not rent from this greedy neglectful man! he had me living in a studion on blacklidge earlier this year that was infested with mice and refused to get professionals to do the job and only set out mice traps that they had already outsmarted. thankfully I was able to terminate lease early bc of it but he also kept 2/3 of my deposit for "cleaning" which is bs because I left the place better than how he gave it to me. hes rude. he doesn't care. all he wants is your money. I promise youll end up regretting it in the end. as you can tell w the previous reviews...RUN!”
- “I had a horrible experience with this "company"!  I should have looked up reviews before renting!!Congratulations to you, for catching this before they caught you!  First of all, the maintenance guy is disgusting! Not only does he use your WiFi to google how-to videos, he's rude and stinks! He said he had to order a part after tearing it apart and leaving it. I was left without AC in the middle of AZ summer, without a dryer for weeks, without a bathroom light/fan/switch and much more. I ended up having to hire a real professional to get the dryer fixed, the AC working, the light switches replaced, light fixtures, weatherstripping and more!   Also, Tom the "manager", was a condescending dick! He is a ignorant know-it-all and doesn't know the concept of customer service, compromise or even kindness.  He evicted me because he had someone offer more money! Even though I was paid in advance he still took me to court so that he could cut my lease short! He will lie through his buck-teeth, straight to your face, with a shit-eating grin! He'll do it over and over until you start questioning reality! His lack of remorse for his egotistical attempts at manipulation and his inability to empathize is the very definition of a psychopath!!  DO NOT RENT FROM THEM!! They will screw you over!”
- “AVOID THIS MAN AT ALL COSTS!!! The very first time we met, he refused to accept the pen back that he gave me for paperwork because, "he didn't want my germs." Should have known then how abnormally rude and awful this experience would be. READ THE FINE PRINT!!! These people do not take care of landscaping or bugs. This may not be the worst thing if his properties were not all MAJORLY COCKROACH INFESTED. I mean our cute, U of A house was completely stripped of its integrity because this company allowed cockroaches to completely take over (living in the walls and pipes.) My roommates and I bought industrial grade poison (expensive) and it barely helped. I have friends from UA who lived in other properties managed by Merritt and they all had cockroaches and bad experiences too. Halfway through our first lease, he reposted our house on Zillow and described it as a foot race to keep the house we were already living in. This was SIX MONTHS before the lease started and we explained that 2/3 of the roommates wanted to stay and needed a little more time to find a new roommate. Absolutely no respect. Lastly, when we moved into the house the paint job trying to cover the last tenants drawings, writings and pictures of penises on the walls were BARELY covered (aka, we could still see all of it) with ONE thin coat of white paint done poorly. We got less than half of our security deposit back because of "paint damage." The house was cleaner and in better shape due to changes we HAD TO MAKE BECAUSE OF COCKROACHES. And he still had the audacity to steal half of our deposit. Please read the other reviews before doing business with this guy because all signs point to SCAM MAN! There are WAY better people in Tucson to work with! Even if this management company was logistically perfect, his personality is so bad that it's not worth it. I'm sure there's more terrible thing I could say, but those are the big ones!”

- “Look its really hard for me to give chipotle that I love a 1 out of 5 stars. But I would give this location a 0. The employees are straight up rude. Mean mugging you while sitting in booths in the lobby. They barely put any ingredients into the burritos, and then just "wrap" them. The food doesnt taste near as good as other chipotles. Drive the mile down the road and go to University or Campbell and ft lowell location. This place sucks. Those places are good. Same company. What the heck is wrong with this place”
- “Came to get dinner around 8pm tonight with my boyfriend, they were out of white and basically brown rice I asked if they had more rice coming they said no so I settled on the bottom of the brown rice she put a tiny tiny amount of rice in like to save for other customers even though realistically there was only two bowls left of rice we asked for a little more she seemed annoyed to do it. We then got to the end and asked for chips they also said they were out of.”
- “I don't even leave reviews regularly but this location is such a disappointment it's almost impressive. Just go down the street to the Campbell location.”

Left 2 messages on their answering machine, and filled out some information on their website which contained my phone # and what I was looking to have done.  It's going on 3 weeks, and never got a call back.  I guess they don't need the business.........”
- “I contacted these guys as they are allegedly the SAHBA Remodeler of the Year for several years in a row.  I was wasting my time.  They advised of the date they would come to look at the project but promised to call and advise of the exact time of arrival.  They didn't.  They showed up at 7:50 AM.  The estimator was very pleasant and they did forward an estimate the same day.  However, when I called to ask questions about the estimate, they would not return my call (2X - and I left a pleasant message both times).  Also, the estimate was for 3-5 times the other estimates I had received.  It appears that they were never really interested in doing the work for me.  If the job was too small, they should have just said that - I would have understood.  Given their splashy adds, one would think they were great.  They are worthless and apparently, my experience is not unusual.  Mike F.  11/16/2021”
- “They were non responsive and poor communicators. Took our money and didn't even finish the design. Then sent us a letter informing us that they could not finish the design process with no explanation. I would not recommend them to anyone.”

Half way though they told me that I didn't have enough mbph (or whatever it is). I paid more. 5 months later they told me the PROBLEM WAS THAT MY LINE WAS DEFECTIVE AND AH OH I COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN THE INCREASED MBPH EVEN IF I DID HAVE A WORKING LINE. Guess what they refunded me.....$50. In their feeble minds this was the 5 months of $10 per month I paid for increased mbph when it wasn't even available. AH....WHAT ABOUT THE DEFECTIVE LINE. AH???????”
- “Don't, don't, don't even think of getting this service. After numerous service calls, techs could not stop service from disconnecting every hour or more.  I tried to live with it for a year, but after 4 days with NO service I finally cancelled. Now I'm being billed almost $200. for an early disconnect. Don't make the same mistake I did. Don't sign up or believe anything they tell you. Worst internet service I have EVER had since the internet was invented.”
- “Trying to get anything resolved with this company is impossible. I was billed almost $300 for a service I never used for not 1 day. It was impossible to close the account and I was lied to and shuffled around from representative to the next all with different answers and promises on how to resolve this issue. 5 months later and there is still no resolve. I wish i could give a zero rating. Save yourself a huge headache from the worst customer service ever.”

- “Here's another update.. this complex has 14 days to return my deposit and they told me that they had the wrong forwarding address (how convenient). By law they have 14 days from my application rejection which was the 23rd of September. Today is October 12th.   Are they that hard up on money that they have to keep $100 application deposit?   Get better employees or management.  First, they don't know how to average my wages by 12 months. Then keep my deposit.   You are in housing violation!  And no.. it is a concern because my pay was more than enough to average in 12 months! I did not need a co-signer. I've never needed a co-signer in ANY of my rentals and you people are discriminating!! This complex purposely made me fail the income. I showed my income with all the pay stubs for the last 12 months and it was more than enough.”
- “If I could give 0 stars, I would. DON'T MOVE HERE This place is ridiculous. Upon moving in, everyone there is seemingly nice and sweet and accommodating. Once they get you in is a different story altogether. There were several items in the apartment with damages and that were just not clean upon moving in that we were assured would be fixed, cleaned, and/or not held against us, we would just need to note them in the lease. Now that we are moving out, they conveniently 'misplaced' that document and are trying to charge us for damages that should have been fixed before we even moved in, and had to live with for a year. Additionally, their attitude is no longer helpful and professional, instead their favorite line is 'there's nothing I can do'.”
- “While gathering research early, I plan to move to Tucson next May, I sent an email and after hearing nothing for 3 business days, I called the office about some of the questions I had.  The lady who answered seemed nice enough at first , when I explained who I was and what I was doing she began to spout off about how great a place to live it was and that it was very quickly sold out.  I asked specifically about the Bridgestone they show on THEIR website as a one bedroom one bath with den and she proceeded to "explain" none of their 2 bedrooms came with just one bath. I let it go already thinking ok this may not be the place for me. Final strike came as I asked about their "all pets welcome" policy as I have 2 Austrailian Shepherds which are a very loving and NON aggressive breed, she didn't know what they were and went to "check her list" coming back to say that they were not allowed on the premises.  Yeah, should have stopped at the first overtalking me like I was stupid incident. onward to next home.”

- “Showed up almost 2 hours late and would not have told me except I called multiple times. Complained the whole time. Reserved 3 hours, but only needed a couple. Charged me the extra hour saying it was a tip for working so hard, which I would never have given them for being so late and unprofessional. Refused to refund any money for the lateness or tip I did not agree to give them.”
- “I was not pleased with this service.  I paid for 3 movers for 3 hrs through uhaul. Never heard a word from them so i called and they scheduled me for 8am. The guy called around 8 to let me know his coworker was running late. Okay, thanks for the heads up. 1 guy showed up at 920am and the other didnt get there til after 1015. They stayed til 1145 and as i was pulling away the one guy asked me for payment. Well, i already paid. Then the other guy he was with said "oh yeah, how am I getting paid?" I didnt even respond to the assinine question. We paid for 3 movers for 3 hrs and got 2 movers for less than 3 hours. We didnt even have 2 movers the entire time.  They didnt finish, my husband moved the majority of items. And still had quite a bit to move in the morning.   The guys were nice and friendly but unprofessional. I feel like i overpaid for the service and would rather have paid more for better service with a different company. They should have stayed at least an extra 30 min to help us.”
- “Showed up 10 min late.  Didn't seem interested in listening to me on how I wanted my items packed.  I specifically asked them to put my large flat screen TV between my mattress as I have done multiple times before.   They either forgot or didn't care and did it their way instead.  I questioned them about how they packed it and they essentially blew me off.  Got to my destination and the screen was cracked from end to end.  Contacted them immediately with pictures and got no response.  Issued a complaint through movinghelp.com and they very politely told me tough luck.  Do yourself a favor and spend a little more for a better service provider.”

- “I had a home warranty and he was the one given to me to use. He came in April and never returned until end of July with parts of a washer lid lock did not stay to make sure it actually worked saying he had other customers but I said I'm a customer. He left of course it didn't work he came back a couple weeks later saying the part was defective and had to order another one, never heard back from this idiot. I hired another appliance repair company and within 3 days it was fixed and said he never installed the lid lock correctly and that's why it wasn't any good. This guy is a complete idiot and made promises and promises to come fix over the months and would never show up. Horrible service I've ever had. He a complete idiot and shouldn't be in business.”
- “NEVER USE THIS COMPANY THEY ARE HORRIBLE CON ARTISTS! My elderly mom with very limited means and numerous health medical condition, was recommended by her home warranty too use 911 Appliance Repair which was a horrible mistake. They sent out a "tech" that told her that the air conditioner coils needed to be clean, and charged her 150,00 to do it. When a family member went on the roof and noticed that coils were never cleaned and now it blowing only hot air now reaching the 90s inside our house. We took pictures that were time stamped and phone records of the numerous calls to Resolve the Issue, they never answer their phones and wont return her phone calls,  to either do the services paid for or return the money. THIS ISSUE STARTED IN JUNE. i am pursuing civil and criminal charges against them.”
- “If I could give them a zero i would. I did not pick this company,  it was picked by my home warranty company but they will not be allowed to come into my home again.  They came out the first day,  very promptly,  but did not fix the problem.  I purchased a new control box for the wall but found out i did not need it. The technician replaced the fuse and connected the old control panel on the wall but did not put the old face plate so I could not return the $200 new control panel  I purchased.  When I got home I changed the pre-programmed settings. The motor turned on and immediately turned off, the control panel would no longer turn on.  I called the company,  several times over the next 7 days with no return call.  Finally on day 7,  I reached someone in the office who scheduled an appointment. My daughter met the technician who had to leave twice: one to purchase a screwdriver and once to purchase the correct fuse.    The technician declared the problem "fixed" because he could feel cool air from the  vent.  I suspect he felt residual air conditioning air because the evaporate cooler was still not working when I got home from work.   I have called almost every day since and did not receive a call back. On day 5 I finally found someone in the office who told me he would call me back later in the day.  As of the next evening I have still not received a call back. but hads yet to do so .  This has been one of the most incompetent companies i have worked with.    Do not call them, do not use them, they are worthless”

- “Cannot EVER get a problem resolved.....neighbors have a TRAILER parked in their driveway, leaving their vehicle on the street, which is definitely not allowed!   I called and these "people", next door must have a special relationship with the management, using the word management loosely..when several of us have called with this issue the standard answer is "They have special permission for this",  okay but it we have a few bricks on the side of the yard to use for our landscaping, we get a letter!!  When I called in regarding the "neighbors" trailer, I was immediately told she did not see we had been approved for any pavers!!   Guess it's not what you know but WHO YOU HAVE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH AT THIS "Management company".”
- “If I could give this place a lower rating then 1 star I would. I've lived at this property since February 2017. When I first moved into the property I had German roaches for the first three months in the kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. My landlady was able to assist as much as she could to eradicate the problem. In the months that I've lived here, I have had about 6 separate occasions where water was either shut off or no hot water available without notice, and about 3 occasions where we were actually given a printed notice letting us know service would be unavailable. The management company representative Stephanie is such a rude woman and acts like your concerns and complaints are not valid. They don't have service to assist you during the weekends for emergencies such as water being unavailable. The hole in the ground that they dug up for the water hasn't even been re paved and an apartment that burnt down  hasn't even been fully repaired. There's always 1-5 TPD officers on sight for some reason or another. There's high drug activity and traffic in this complex, and not to be judgemental but you can physically see who is a resident and who's just passing through for their drugs. I have had multiple Amazon packages stolen off my front porch while I've been home. One package was a Lego set for my son, I went outside and loudly complained about it being stolen and that they didn't steal the package from me but my 5 year old son and it magically reappeared on my porch about two days later. The complex itself needs extreme upkeep and repair on the outside of the building. There's always sewer cockroaches outside of the buildings on the walls or the floor. I have absolutely hated my experience here. I wouldn't recommend this property to anyone. I do not believe that Stratford Management cares about their home owners or their renters.”
- “Poor service, poor communication, poor accountability. I've dealt with Stratford now for 13 years, not by choice, but they manage my community. They provide no real service other than assessing fines & collecting money.  They're dropped the ball on several communications with me regarding my property, including assessing a $50 fine for a single weed in my yard that was 2 inches tall and had no evidence of even delivering a notice to my property, yet still assessed a fine. I'm honestly strategizing with others in my community to have them removed as the manager of the entire community & working with another local provider to make this happen.”

- “Cashier stole $10 from me. I gave him a $20 bill I had just got from an ATM and he acted like I had just given him a 10. He still had the 20 in his hand but he claimed it was in his drawer already. I guess he just randomly takes $20 bills out and holds them while serving customers.  I made a complaint to their corporate offices but I have heard nothing back from them. I doubt I will.  I'm told I should have called the cops but I honestly didn't think of it until later. At any rate, if you go here, avoid using cash, or keep a close eye on the guy you give your money too...you might not get it all back.”
- “The clerk was nice, but............I cashed in a lottery ticket worth $20 and the clerk gave me 8 of it in coins. I asked, seriously, that's all you have? Who does that? I almost never go to 7-11, and this solidifies why I'll never go again.”
- “I live 2 streets away and frequent the store. My puppy was lost. I asked manager if I could post flier for lost puppy, since a lot of the people who live in that area go in there. He was very rude to me and said no. Doesn't he know people love their pets? I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING AT THIS STORE EVER AGAIN!! Please all people who care about their pets boycott this store. You think a store that makes it's money off the community would support it”

- “Same experience as everyone else. Used them through the home warranty for a broken ice maker. They replaced some temperature sensors and said it would fix it. It didn't but they told the home warranty they had. Run around run around. Going on 2 months. They don't seem to care about customer service because they just keep getting home warranty jobs.”
- “United Services of Arizona (USA) provided the worst customer service I've ever experienced. USA was assigned by American Home Shield to fix my refrigerator/freezer that was not freezing or cooling properly. A technician diagnosed the problem as a heating element that needed to be replaced. He said it would take 1 - 2 weeks to get the part shipped. I told him I had already lost my frozen food over the several days it took to get the appointment and the freezer was cooling only to 44 degrees, which is unsafe for refrigerated food (the refrigerator was cooling only to 66 degrees). He said they have to go through a specific vendor and that's just how it is. I called a local appliance parts store just a few miles from my home and they have the part in stock and it costs $55. I called USA several times over the next several days to ask them to get the part locally and fix the problem. USA rarely answers the phone and a recording says they only retrieve messages between 10:00 - 4:00 so don't leave a message after those hours. After several messages by me and American Home Shield, USA left a message for me saying it would take 1 - 2 weeks for the part to come in. This is unacceptable as for up to 2 weeks I am forced to eat food not cooled properly, which has a strong likelihood of causing food poisoning. It is clear USA and American Home Shield won't accommodate reasonable customer needs to prevent possible health issues. I called American Home Shield to request the $75 I paid for the technician's visit, which I haven't seen yet. Because of this horrible customer service, I am cancelling American Home Shield an filed a complaint with them against USA. I found an appliance repair company that is coming promptly to fix the problem.  I will also post a review on Yelp and warn people to stay away from USA and American Home Shield.”
- “3 visits over a month's time to my home to repair a dishwasher and it's still not fixed.  Lots of arguing with them via text message to request a replacement, which yielded no results.  Either can't fix it or they don't know how to fix it. Either way doesn't work for me. They were sent by American Home Shield.  I asked AHS to send another repair company, and they eventually did.  Repairman was very nice, but he couldn't affect the repair.  Over 2 months later, the dishwasher is still broken.”

- “I've tried this store multiple times. Every time was a bad experience. I thought maybe the first time was due to the wrong timing or whatever, so I gave it another chance, but no, this place generally sucks. The store staff are very disrespectful and the customers are even worse. Very disappointing. My family and I will not be using this store again.”
- “Disgusting!!!!!!!!!  While finishing my transaction, my checker, Michaela started digging her ear wax with her pinky fingernail, got a chunk out, examined it and flicked the earwax out using another one of her fingernails.  She then offered my receipt to with the same hand. I said gross and I did not want my receipt.  Then she continues handling food.  I let Hayley, the front end manager know, she seemed hostile and not helpful at all.  It seemed like she was to busy to care and was really awful to talk to I did not feel better at all.”
- “I won't be going back to this store.  I went specifically because they had quite a few things on sale that I wanted.  When I couldn't find a specific ice cream flavor, I asked a clerk at the checkout if they had any in the back.  He called someone to check, and they never responded.  He offered to go look himself, and came back and said he didn't find anything.  Okay ... that happens.  I asked for a raincheck and he looked at me and said "We don't honor rainchecks; we haven't for about a year."     I was already unhappy.  The store was really dirty, and I felt very uncomfortable there.  When I found out they don't honor their sales ads, I turned and walked out.  This Fry's (and maybe the rest of them in the area) will not be getting my business.”

- “When can I expect my final paycheck?  I did the work and I expect my money.  I was decent enough to give you a 2 weeks notice!  You were supposed to have it 2 weeks ago and now im getting the run around!  Is this how you do business and should your residents expect similar treatment?  If a tenant was late with payment you would have already started eviction precedings!”
- “What can I say?!? I signed a one year lease agreement here and  I am now breaking it 6 months later. Not sure what is worse here the roaches, the mice, the tweakers fighting out side on a nightly basis or the staff that doesnt do shit about any complaints and dont get me started about corporate because they dont do shit either, they stand behind their management team no matter how horrible and unlivable the place is!!”
- “This place is the worst apartment complex I have ever lived in on so many different levels. Please if your looking for somewhere to live do NOT choose this place! First off the professionalism of the front office is non existent! None of the employees remember your name or your problems no matter how many times you've been in there. Makes you feel kinda unimportant and as someone who is paying rent monthly that's not a great feeling. None of the staff members communicate with each other every time I'm in there I have to explain my issue all over again for the 100th time. I've had a leak in my celling for a little over a month, with promises of a whole new "a/c unit" nothing was ever replaced they simply patched up the leak and replaced the dry wash that was damaged. My Carpet was soaked, they also promised to send someone to clean my carpet, NEVER HAPPENED! And when I complained of how long these issues where taking to be handled I was told the staff has way too many work orders to only worry about mine. Basically we'll fix it when we get to it! There's sketchy ass people walking around all the time, not to mention unsupervised children always in the pool area! The apartment it self is actually not that bad, nice layout up to date appliances however the way the staff is just completely ruins this place. They are quick to collect your rent but not complete work orders. We can not wait to be done w this lease!”

## Tips from customers
Nice place friendly staff clean place dose events Run away as fast as you can, this place has way too much violence. There are constantly police being called, murders just feet away from your door gun shots every night, these thugs walking around flashing guns, random kids everywhere with no parents to be found, crack heads dogging in the dumpster and peeking over the wall of your patio to see what they can steal.Completely disgusting don't waste your time and money here, your health and safety are not guaranteed. Lydia Peralta is why I stay here! She's awesome, handles problems very well.

- “Do yourself a favor and find somewhere else. Guy cleaning Carpet was upset that he wouldn't be able to complete the job in an hour even though he was told we had a very large house, hidden fees were numerous, house was empty so he kept encouraging my husband to leave I think so he could do a really crappy job and leave before anyone got back carpets were cleaned terrible were left extremely wet smelled awful was charged WAY more then quoted. Wouldn't use them again if it was free....  I give minus five stars............    I want to add I think it's ridiculous that yelp only had 3 reviews that bumps stars up. I reviewed this when it first happened and wrote this review because it wasn't in reviews and thought my review was lost, then found this buried section.  I had never written a review before the initial review on this place, I was just so incredibly disgusted by this company that I had to try to warn people. 5 star would HAVE to be fake this co SUCKS!!!!!!!  It WILL be on your list of worst mistakes if you hire thus company!!!!!  I don't know how it would even stay in business can't possible have return customers and definitely no referrals”

- “I had to stay at a place while looking for off campus student housing. I wanted it bare bones and CHEAP! Right down the street is a Best Western that had FANTASTIC rooms with everything...for about $65 a night. So the whining pussies on here that gave this place a bad rating were simply being greedy. You are not going to get a best western or above type room for $28 a night...just not going to happen! You STAY at a place like COPPER CACTUS INN for 2 reasons: location and price and NOTHING ELSE! It is 1 block to pima community college,..... across the street from the famous MEET MARKET dive bar.  ......2 min drive to the U of A, etc, etc, etc....  i enjoyed handing over a twenty a five and 3 ones for my stay. I would not have enjoyed handing over 3 twenties just to have a flat screen and a cleaner room.  I am giving this place 5 stars because at 10:30pm at night...my window aircon quit working. I went over to the manager window expecting to be told to wait until morning, but instead, the manager, his wife, and his son, got a BRAND NEW airconditioner out of their storage, came by and replaced it and 30 mins later, I was relaxing on my cheap bed watching my cheap tv in cool cool comfort before I passed out into la la land. BOTTOM LINE: If you are a PUSSY and a SHIT FOR BRAINS.....pony up $60 or $70 and STAY at the Best Western.  If you are a REAL man that has any true grit...been in the military, not born with a silver spoon in your mouth etc....you can handle the COPPER CACTUS INN.  All others: Please please please close your legs.....we can see your vagina!”

This is the worst motel I've EVER stayed in!”

I booked a 2-queue size beds room, I am sure the bed is NOT queue size, either full or double  2. the window is broken, we can't get it locked  3. there is no lock on door, we were really worried all night that someone might broken in.  4.

- “Worst customer service ever...I finally cancelled my policy through State Farm but this guy continued to steal money out of my account via automatic withdrawal over a month AFTER my cancellation.  If he's your agent don't trust a word they say..”
- “This agent contacted me offering lower rates than my current insurance. We went back and forth over email discussing options and I agreed to switch my auto insurance. The emails stopped right before my current policy was due to renew, but before I had the chance to purchase their policy. I can't get ahold of anyone at the office, so I guess they don't want my money. I'm really disappointed considering the rates they were offering were significantly lower than what I currently pay.”
- “Have 4 cars & a house with State Farm for the past 27 years. Ever since my agent retired, I have had nothing but problems with All Vasey and staff. My quoted premium has never been what I have been billed. Its a shame after almost 30 years of being a "valued" customer one person can devalue you and force you to go elsewhere. I strongly recommend staying away from this company”

- “Roaches! all my luggage is going in large trash bags for two weeks minimum after I get home. This place isn't super at all. I will never stay here ever again. The only reason I did stay here was because it was a work trip.yeah we all agreed this is not the spot to stay. I only gave this a star because I had to in order to get this review out. Steer clear of this spot!”
- “I wouldn't wish a serial killer to stay in this place .  Nuff said!  But seriously the minute I pulled up this to this motel it was sketch city!  And I just moved from a rough neighborhood in Los Angeles were people were regularly freebasing on the street.  And for a 150 night. GTFO.  I had no choice to stay here because I already booked on Priceline and it was too late to make any other safer arrangements.    The lady at the front desk was rude.  She snapped at me she tried to call me twice to say there were no nonsmoking rooms available.  She did not.  Went in to the room and basically the motel rooms you see in tv in movies where people are renting to get high were nicer then this place.  And im certain thats what the rooms are regularly used for.  Because....  PLEASE DONT BRING YOUR PET!  My dog ingested something the short time were were in these filthy rooms.  Her eyes were bugging out of her head and she was tweaking out!  Her eyes became red and irritated and 24 hours late whatever she ingested in this room is still in her system!  Probably drug residue in the dirty carpets!  Also the room smelled of severe cigarette smoke (drug addicts). Burns all over the sheet, beds, and carpets!    Only positive is was the man working at 6am that checked me out.  ( I slept only and hour and a half all night because my dogs was tweaking out and I was scared to death!) He was very nice and walked me to my car.  I hope he finds a nicer place to work.”
- “The owner/manager asked what problems we had. I began by telling him that our room refrigerator had no shelves. He replied in a short manner: "We don't do that here"and thrust my receipt at me, then turning his back and ignoring me until I left.  The air conditioner was falling through the wall and there were several externally wired lamps in the room. There is a large and sloppy patch in the wall of the room. There was a very primitive overall feel to the room and there was a running gun battle in the street adjascent to the motel the first night we were there. What I  wish I could show you was the "Breakfast area".   In a space barely ten feet square, there is the front desk and three tiny tables are crammed together in a corner are with extremely limited seating. There is a sign forbidding clients from taking food to their rooms, resulting in chaos, frustration and overflow in the mornings. The waffle maker is it's own special hell. The batter is so watery that the waffles barely hold together, and the per-measured ( and crusted and FILTHY) plastic containers hold 2/3 as much as is needed for a waffle, resulting in 'lace-y" and unsatisfying waffles with little opportunity to make a second, due to the crush of hungry guests and the lack of room. The utensil containers are caked with not just a single day's dust and filth but several week's worth, making one wonder if we are taking our lives in our hands by partaking of the free breakfast.”

Rude staff. To get the room door open you have to kick it like a cop!!

- “My son received a hair cut there today. The haircut was just ok.. What annoyed me was that they charged a $4 dollar "sanitation fee". What for, exactly? They didn't even sanitize the chair in between customers. But even if they did, they should be doing that anyway as a courtesy. COVID or not. And so they are charging $4 to supposedly sanitize, which I did not witness. Horrible management. Nope. Never again. Bye.”
- “Now adding$4 to a cut for cleaning. This implies that they weren't cleaning between customers before Covid and now it is a new expensive costly procedure to wipe down a chair. That increases the price of a cut by 25%. They are using the pandemic to make more money. The people who work there do a fine job at cutting, if not with conversation but the cost increases are such that I am going to just start going to a more professional salon.”
- “Me and my 3 boys went in for standard haircuts.  Two of my sons' were good and I felt they did fine but my youngest son's haircut was subpar.  I didn't notice until we got home and my wife had a chance to look at it.  She took my son back and rather than working with her, they argued about giving us a refund.  My wife wanted them to fix the haircut and refund us for the haircut. Rather than finding a solution that would make everyone happy, they stated that they would fix it or refund.  The manager finally came out of hiding and after much discussion, my wife let them fix it and thought we were getting a refund.  After they tried again, they told us they were no longer getting the refund. My wife spent close to 45 min there.  The manager is enept and doesn't give very good haircuts.  The're too many places in tucson to spend $60+ to get a hair cut so we won't be back.”

- “This school doesn't deserve the 1 star that I'm giving... This school started out "promising " compared the TUSD schools on the southwest side but things quickly changed. Multiple teachers leaving, very poor leadership from the principal and her team of minions. Stay away from this school, they do not have the best interests in mind for the students, only for themselves, watch out if you ever question them on their so called "policies".”
- “The teachers aid slapped a kid, and they did nothing about it. You know why? She's a coke addict who's only working there because her mom is HR and needs to keep an eye on her man child daughter. Not surprising, as how the father of the very same teachers aid was a janitor that got fired after grabbing the owner's child in the bathroom. Oh, but he was quick to be fired. Lots of conflicts of interest, your child will be verbally and physically abused by a mentally slowed woman with total impunity, because the school's simp owner is too scared to man up, leave his alcoholic felan wife, and fire the HR hag and her retarded child abuser”

- “If I could do zero stars I would. They bully kids with special needs and are perverts. This school is a huge disgrace right along with the special ed director, aids and principal.  Shame on this disgusting school.  All they care about is donations not the kids themselves.  They are one of the worst schools around.  What kind of people bully a disabled kid who can not defend themselves .”
- “This school employs  the most racist people that I've ever met. Whichever staff member who was in charge of checking the tickets at tonight's graduation is very unprofessional. She was overly nice to every single person who walked up to her before me and my daughter walked up.  As soon as i walked up her tone and demeanor completely changed and she was very rude to me for NO reason whatsoever. It's as if she was bothered by the color of my skin or something because she kept staring at me as if she was disgusted or something. It's sad because i really liked the school before this but i will now let my friends and family know about tonights experience.  I will no longer recommend this school to anyone that i know. Such a shame!”

- “Lincare has not even read the Industry Mandatory Supplier Standards, much less complies with them./  They violate nearly every standard.  When a patient, whose family member is an industry inspector, calls about a complaint, which they must log and resolve, instead they become verbally abusive and refuse to take the complaint.  They are dangerous.  As a trauma nurse, my recommendation is to avoid this company.”
- “This is a totally dysfunctional company that does not keep any part of their business in order.  No one knows what anyone else is doing.  They do not bill correctly, nor do they deliver the correct equipment.  Do not use them for any of your medical equipment needs.”

## Tips from customers
Horrible costumer service, they say one thing and mean another. Dave the warehouse man is a ghost, never available to speak with. We are now at a month and a half waiting for a small O2 concentrator to be returned from the factory. They didn't even ship it for over two weeks after it was in their possession. I would not recommend this sorry company to anyone. Stunningly incompetent at every turn. Stunningly incompetent in every possible way.

Whatever the reason,  the faculty and staff have done a great jobs incorporating the community in events. Recently, they improved the exterior of this place by installing new rocks.

- “OTW Out.  This was a place of transition, and I'm thrilled to transition out. Great Staff and Maintenance Professionals.”
- “It's a shame that I had to rate this place one star cause unfortunately they deserve no star at all. Sieanna Apartments have been everything but what "they say" they stand for. On their website they state they are "At your service" if you are a tenant. Every tenant there will absolutely disagree that that's what they stand by. Beyond many many things, here are a just a few of the scenarios that I will give to prove that Sieanna are unprofessional, careless and definitely not worth renting from.  First, these apartments are HIGHLY infested with bed bugs. BEWARE!! (As when you sign a lease agreement they will make you sign a waiver that if you are ever infested it is your duty to take care of it.. Hmm sounds like they are clearly aware of this situation.) They will do everything possible to make you feel as if you are in fault when it comes to bed bugs. And do absolutely nothing to help you get rid of a problem that they initially never took care of before your move in. Tenants are constantly moving furniture in and out thinking it'll get rid of bed bugs but the infestation clearly needs professional help as in heat lamps. Too bad that cost over $2000 and can't seem to be at your service then.  Second, ANY work placed, please do not hold your breathe, as if may take months for anything to be done. Try living with clogged sinks, no working stove, and no AC in the summer.. Been there. As I said these are just some scenarios my family and I  lived through and experienced myself.  Third, good luck on getting along with management, they are extremely rude and like I previously mentioned, completely careless. I'm frustrated and overwhelmed with all that I've gone through because of this place. If someone would have warned me prior never would I have made this a place of my living. Cause my home is not a home but a nightmare. Please take the time to take this inconsideration. As I am currently fighting to get out of my lease, been in contact with my lawyer and trying to make my departure as soon as possible. Thank you for your time and good luck!!”
- “Horrible customer service from the manager.  I went in this morning to talk to her but immediately felt like I didn't matter or that my time was not important.  Do not spend money at an apartment complex that doesn't care about their customers.  If they don't care in the beginning, they won't care months into your lease.”

- “Horrible "mimosa" festival in Tucson. The drinks were Kool aid with no champagne. It was pathetic and I want my money back. That won't happen.”
- “I've been to a LOT of events here in Tucson, and the "TUCSON SANGRIA FESTIVAL" on 1/11/2020 hosted at The Rock was BY FAR the worst event I've ever wasted money on..  Very poor choice of location.. The Rock is a dive bar... EXTREMELY dark inside and not enough seating area on the patio.   We bought 4 VIP tickets, not to mention 4 other friends bought 4 VIP tickets. The VIP included a t-shirt...which, were were literally plain black shirts only avail in medium and large.. and said "VIP CLUB SANGRIA FESTIVAL 2020". I actually laughed when I saw these knowing I could've made one better myself...   VIP included the shirt, and 2 extra drink tickets. Which, by noon, everyone included NON-VIP were grabbing everything that was only supposed to be available for VIP.   There was one person the entire time giving tickets, putting wristbands on, so the line was out the door.   Upon walking in, there were 4 jugs of "sangria" on the bar. 4 different flavors. Which, I thought to myself, "there must be more outside..". As this was my experience at the last Sangria festival at TCC. (Which, I'm almost CERTAIN is not done by the same event hosts). We were shocked that there was only 4 types of sangria to choose from.   The drinks were pretty watered down. They ended up running out of one flavor by 12:30. There were supposed to be two raffles. Only one was done. There was supposed to be a VIP raffle for a TV and an iPad, which never happened.   Another thing was that, we paid $50.00 (almost ($40 with the NEWYEAR discount) which, what we paid for, this was NOT even close to being worth it. I was so upset that we had paid that much and we all felt like it was so overpriced.  There were people coming in (not VIP) and they were just giving away the shirts, and sunglasses, the koozies to whoever. It was so poorly organized and if I would've got the same swag that was given to regular tickets, I would have NEVER paid for VIP. These event hosts/company is the biggest scam I've ever experienced.. I (as well as the other 6 other people who went with me) will NEVER pay to go to an event hosted by them again.”
- “Don't waste your time with this company. They "hosted" a local margarita crawl promising 3-5 vendors participation with discounted drinks. The crawl was scheduled from 2-8p. The first location had decent specials and was the pickup point for our wristbands. The second place was not aware that they were event participating and did not have any specials/offers for the attendees. The third and last location was not even open until 5pm. I requested a refund and was told they were working on it. After multiple follow-ups, they still haven't awarded a refund for any of the event attendees and it's now 2 months later. Highly disappointed. The local businesses even reported that they will not work with this company anymore.”

- “Training level at this company is non-existent.  They hold my federal student loans and I recently moved from regular employment to self-employment with a significant reduction in monthly income.  They would only accept my Form 1040 as documentation of income and the change in monthly payment increased from $44/mo to over $1,000/mo.  I had plans to move on with my life and purchase a home after rehabbing my loans, now, I have one more year before I can afford to rehabilitate and then two more years before I can settle down.  There are not enough bad words in any dictionary to describe the utter frustration and anger that I currently am experiencing solely as a result of their representatives incompetence and failure to understand their own policies.”

Never return phone calls or emails.  Very unwilling to help resolve issues with errors on the settlement statement.  Closing with them was a terrible experience. Did not want to take the time to answer my questions. I had to be my own advocate with everything because there were so many errors.”
- “If you get Gretchen Cochran as your Title Officer, you are screwed! She's great on business development apparently, but non-existent on delivery. We had her on a CRE purchase a few years ago and she was terrible then - no follow up, multiple errors on the settlement, and we were writing checks to people that were shorted long after close. We recently bought a second and the seller's agent insisted on using her. More of the same. Got prorated calculations backwards, had her staff call to clean up her messes. Disorganized and incompetent in our view. One star is too many.   Hi i'm Gretchen - welcome to Walmart!”
- “Not a great experience. Pam Ross was my Escrow Agent.  Never got an advance copy of the Settlement Statement. When I mentioned that, the response was "there wasn't enough time".  They also have junk fees ($160 for fed ex, filing, etc.) which they refused to remove. My husband and mother-in-law both worked as executives in the mortgage business in Washington DC and confirmed the junk fees.  And, lastly, Pam was giving incorrect tax info - insisting I sign the tax form a certain way which I knew was incorrect. I have 3 more houses to sell and one to buy in the next 24 months.  I will NEVER use them again.”

It was supposed to be delivered on November 11th 2021. It has been sitting at my local facility since that date and still has not made it on a truck to be delivered. When I check the tracking every day, it's out for delivery but by 6:30 p.m. it shows delayed. Over the entire week I have sent three emails have contacted then 4 separate times. I get the same information that they will escalate the issue and request an ETA. When the ETA comes back they'll contact me and let me know when delivery will happen. I still have not been contacted back. I still don't have an ETA and more importantly, I still don't have my package. I offered to pick it up. It is now November 16th.”
- “If I could give a negative review I would.  My package which contains my 14 year old son's Christmas presents has been at the Tucson facility since 12/15.  It showed it would be delivered on the 16th.  I live about 20 minutes from their facility.  To date no delivery and the site continues to push back the date.  I called customer service who told me someone from the facility would call.  No call.  It is Christmas Eve and the tracking now says 12/27 delivery.  How do you tell your son that he has no presents due to the incompetence of this company.  I will never order from any company that utilizes OnTac as a shipper.”
- “They are complete trash, drivers opening and stealing packages, customer care doesn't care whatsoever.  "The sender is our client not you so we deliver when we get around to it" "our drivers make mistakes but that's bot our fault". Absolutely unacceptable ⁉ I will not support any company using this unreliable company.”

- “I stayed here few months back and got arrested, so I had alot tools and other items left in the room. I sent my brother to pick up the items with power if attorney but  and my brother trying get them and rudely he said sorry they was trashed.  So $1000 worth tool "brand new in box". Was just thrown away?  So I left and decided call manager which was same person and just ask for his name and he hung up on me.. I tried again and he just picked up phone and hung up.. after few tries with same result, I stopped trying and keep in mind not once did I tell or raise my voice or try to argue..  This man was very rude and disrespectful, I would not recommend this place to anyone, they will steal your stuff and be rude about it.”
- “I have been staying here for about 4 months and I actually liked it at first. The girl in the office was great and the price was reasonable but for the past month or two it's gone way downhill. First off I pay weekly and thought as long as I paid before the cut off time I'd be fine ( nobody said any different), but then one week I went to pay and they told me someone had reserved my room and I had like an hour to pack up and leave so needless to say I was pissed. Half way through packing they knocked and said they cancelled the reservation so I was fine. I told them I would be here a while and would give them notice when I planned to leave so I didn't expect the SAME THING to happen 2 more times and be treated incredibly rudely to boot! After the last time I was told my room would be blocked so it wouldn't happen anymore um..(Why wasn't that done way earlier?)! So this morning I got a knock telling me I should hurry and pay because my room was open AGAIN! WTF!! Next issue is I had been paying the same price every week until last week when it went up almost $200..... temporarily because of the gem show I was told. Then come to find out the gem show was cancelled this year AND the price gouging is actually a PERMANENT THING! Why the f**k would anyone pay almost $500 A WEEK to stay in a place with absolutely no extras or incentives. No one has ever come in and cleaned, I use my own linens and towels and I've never seen a complimentary breakfast. To top it off I went to do my laundry tonight to find out the laundry room is locked after 8pm. (Before tonight it had been open 24/7 since I started staying here!)! I mean come on. So yeah I'm gone tomorrow and I would recommend staying pretty much ANYWHERE ELSE if you can at all help it!   BONUS: You can knock on pretty much any door and find whatever drug you might want! Oh and there have been at least two altercations where guns were pulled and shot since I've been here!   Bottom line.......Stay at your own risk!”
- “booked this stay almost 2 months in advance for a weeks stay. traveling from thousands of miles away and between flights i receive a message that my booking is cancelled !!!! WOW had someone call hotel on my behalf and found out they have no available rooms.... this literally hours before on the day of my arrival. Management could care less for their customers. Offered NO compensation just a refund of the charges. "here is your refund..goodluck" so sad..... too bad.....   seriously ???? Now last second we had to take any available room i could find at any hotel even though it did not meet my requirements and ended up costing me much more for this trip. Luckily i did not end up sleeping w my child in the rent a car. PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE. Everyone should boycott this establishment. How shameful to leave a mom and her child to fend for themselves. Management should be fired.”

- “Called in tonight because the power in our apartment got shut off. The first rep informed us that our power was "disconnected on April 6 due to non payment" and that "someone reconnected our power so we haven't been getting charged for power and have been stealing electricity" which is completely false and the account has not been past due and is up to date on payments and also we don't have access to the meter in our apartments. They then hung up mid conversation. When calling in again we were informed it was turned off regarding missing info. Again, false. When we told the rep what the last one said she said that she agreed with the first rep and we had to call in at 7am to get more help. So she contradicted her first statement and lied to us. Then when we asked for help tonight because we need power and ac as we live in the desert they informed us "we can just relocate". Her name was Angie and I am dumbfounded on the fact that i have just received this horrific customer service and then was told to just relocate. What a joke. Now getting legal help because we were "energy diverting".  Have a great night Angie you made ours!”
- “Seriously, I have never been more disrespected by a customer service representative in my entire life. If you can avoid using TEP do, because you will lose a lot of money and get treated awful.   I have used TEP for the last two places I lived in in Tucson, the last one being an apartment. When I moved and had to transfer my account and information to the new location I called TEP to do so and they were so rude and not helpful at all with the process. Then when moving out of the last home, I submitted a request online to stop my account and end my billing. IT IMMEDIATELY KICKED ME OUT OF MY ACCOUNT AND WOULDN'T LET ME BACK IN! I tried multiple times to access this account again so that I could make sure my billing had ended but it told me my email was linked to no account and my account # was INCORRECT...?   I recently just received a bill from TEP (when I was moved out for a month now without their service). When I called them to discuss the bill they were so rude and inconsiderate. They first told me that I never registered my email with their system, THAT I HAD BEEN USING TO PAY MY BILLS, RECEIVE UPDATES, AND TRACK MY USAGE ON for the last 4 years!!! The representative spoke to me in with so much sass and attitude while not offering a solution to this problem just to get over it and pay my bill. Extremely rude, unprofessional and a waste of time. Never use this company if you want to be treated like a worthless human being and waste hundreds of dollars.”
- “You pay late twice in a 12 month period and they force you over to cash payments only, stupidest thing I've ever heard. If I got paid in cash I'd be using cash, but I have a card like most people these days. Worst power company ever.”

## Tips from customers
TEP has a neo nazi skinhead working at the power plant and has for years. There are multiple complaints online from employees about a racist environment there and this employee is covered in swastikas and other nazi propaganda tattoos while supervising minorities. It's time to stop allowing this kind of institutionalized racism! Actually I have found Tucson Electric Power to be very responsive. If I have a question I can get it answered quickly. They have a policy of good communication.

- “I have been a customer of Comcast, Cox, Directv, and Dish - Dish is by far the worst when it comes to TV service, customer service, cost vs. quality. I fulfilled my contract with them and to cancel I get charged, to give back the equipment I get charged. They had a limited number of HD channels. Further, when they list channels as being available in certain packages, beware because they may drop them or move them to other packages. So you really don't get what you thought you were paying for. Also, be aware that the first price offered is for a limited time only, then it is jacked up and you are paying at least (if not more) as much as you did with the other companies but for poorer quality and you're stuck in that 2-year contract. You will be penalized if you need to end the contract even a few days early. I was paying for satellite service when I didn't even have a TV (all in storage for my move) for the last 1-1/2 weeks of service of the 2-year contract in order to avoid an early termination fee. Now I'm charged to return their equipment, at least it's cheaper than the fee for not returning the equipment.”
- “Once again Dish has turned off Fox network right during baseball playoffs, football and the start of hockey not to mention college football. It's fine for Dish to raise your price by a double digit percent but they crybaby when a network wants an increase. So tell me Dish, with the money you're saving by not paying Fox how much are you going to credit your customers? This is a win win for Dish and we, the customers lose. I can assure you I won't be renewing my contract when it comes time. If Dish management had any smarts they would have ironed this out prior to shutting Fox down. Oh, BTW, Dish is blaming Fox and wants us to call Fox and complain. Sorry Dish, I have a contract with YOU, not Fox and I hold you wholly responsible for this. Really doesn't matter anymore, Dish will be out of business within a few years considering all the streaming platforms becoming available at attractive prices. I've also notified everyone on nextdoor. com about your little scam you have going and suggested to not do business with you.”
- “Unfortunately I have a bad experience with DISH that I hope no one ever has to go through. When I moved out of one home after divorce they talked me into putting my account on hold for further discount when I opened up new one in new home. I opened up new account within 3 months and had the other one cancelled but apparently I didn't talk with Customer Service only Sales so they had the charges for each month after 3 months accrued for that old account. I tried to call DISH with my name, phone, address where the old account was and they couldn't help me to cancel because I didn't have the actual 16 digit account number. The bills were paid by my ex-husband and he had a final bill when he talked to DISH person prior to me moving out. So they sent it out to collections and unfortunately it was under my daughter's name. I had them change the name and contact for that "past due" account to mine so they can stop harassing her. This is a scam for putting the account on pause and not speaking to the correct department to cancel with the old account number, although they can look it up under my phone number they couldn't help me when I tried to stop the "pause" although they know I have a new account with them. They offered $50 off a balance due of $96 but refuse to pay anything! Very, very wrong on many levels!!!!!!”

I was refused a refund, Ashish, the manager is a total douchebag. Health department ought to close it down. Absolutely gross. Also known as the Regal inn. Sh@thole.”
- “THE WORST HOTEL IN USA.  I have been traveling throughout the US for 20 + years and have just found the WORST hotel in America. This is the OYO Hotel in Tuscon Az off Interstate 10. Reception is closed - you basically check in through a window, the manager is obnoxious, rude and should never be in a position to work or deal with the public. I couldn't believe how he treated a guest ahead of me during checkin time (which is at 3pm and not a minute sooner).

- “This Jack in the box used to be good when it first opened about a year ago.   Unfortunately, it is terrible now.  I went here often but will not go again.  They do not care about the quality of food they put out.  Their eggs and hash browns obviously sit out forever.  The eggs on the sandwich are cold and rubbery. The hash browns are always cold greasy and soggy.  It's the same with their fries. Always cold and taste old. I would be embarrassed if I was the manager putting food out like that.  Manager needs to address the quality of the midnight shift food in a major way.  I literally had to throw my food away and go get something else up the road.    When you give a company your money, you should expect to get what they advertise.”
- “I pulled up and y'all had the drive through and lobby closed off. It was already about 11:30 a.m. Y'all had me twisted I drove all the way to y'all just to not be served. WACK”

Nasty old tacos i wont be back to this place

- “I paid $800 for a rodent exclusion package that came with a 1 year warranty. I was promised that the guy would look under my house and check everywhere for any points of entry. He stayed for 30 min, did work inside, and then left without making a follow up appointment. Just look at the job he did! Pushed some wire haphazardly into a hole and RUINED my kitchen cabinets by getting the black filler all over it. Horrible!  After months of waiting, I contacted him. Then I waited a couple weeks for him to arrange a time. When he finally did come over, he stayed for about 30 min. This time he opened up a side panel under my house and shined a flashlight around and said "Looks all good." Wow so professional!  During his initial visit I told him of a hole under my guest bathroom sink. He said there wasn't any sign of rodent activity so he wouldn't do anything about it. Lo and behold months later I find a dead mouse in a trap by that very same hole. So I contacted him to come back (since I'm still covered with my warranty). I have been waiting over a month for this guy to even schedule an appointment with me.  Communication with Terminix is absolutely dreadful. I would never recommend going with them for rodent exclusion services. Apparently they only have one guy who does this work in ALL of Tucson. And worst still, he's terrible at it!!”
- “Worst customer service ever!  Not even McDonald's treats their customers this bad. I've been a customer for 10 years and Lenny the Tucson manager is a rude unprofessional manager.  I have termite activity in my home.  I never missed a payment.  I have been waiting for over a year to get this taken cared of and no one can take care of it.”
- “Absolutely the worst customer service I have experienced in a very long time. It is ridiculous that I cannot contact the local Tucson office to schedule an inspection. Spent nearly 20 minutes with a nationwide scheduling representative trying to reschedule an appointment from 4 to 6 PM to an earlier time. I was told that someone would contact me within 24 hours, which was over a week ago. Today I receive a voicemail saying I had an appointment later this week between the hours of 4-6 PM when I specifically directed them I did not want anyone to come around dinner time, plain and simple one would think. So now, I have been on hold for yet another 20 minutes trying to speak to a "supervisor" about scheduling an appointment around my schedule, not theirs. I don't see a customer CANNOT call the local office to speak to a LOCAL representative to coordinate LOCAL service. I am thinking that after this contract period, I will do my business with a local service company. Would NOT and will NOT recommend their service to any other homeowner.”

- “At this point it literally feels like being harassed by this building I've had issues from the beginning wether it be getting bullied out of a unit because of their mistake or maintenance showing up randomly or expecting maintenance and have no one show up. As a single girl living here I don't feel comfortable.”
- “As I was reading the anonymous comment of a resident that was posted on 5/28/2021, I got inspired to write this review as I understand and confirm 100% of all the things that the review is saying. I lived in Aspire for the past two years and I was and still am very disappointed about this place (literally just moved out 3 months ago). Everything seems nice at the beginning when they give you and your parents the tour of the place/facilities and apparently everything looks great... but it is not. To begin with, I moved in when the apartment complex was built (more like still being built), even though they sold as it was already done and classes HAD ALREADY STARTED. The first weeks it was a nightmare: fire alarms going off at 8am everyday, elevators out of work all the time so you had to climb your way up the stairs with your fully packed backpack, people coming to "inspect" your apartment all the time no matter the time and day, some closet doors were put the wrong way, even the pool fell a couple floors and nobody said anything to the residents! By then I was really concerned about my safety as I was living in one of the top floors... imagine what could have happened. Other things that went badly with this place and my apartment include that my AC stopped working for a full period of 3 weeks and it was leaking. I ain´t talking about a drop of water or two, no, it was a FULL Niagara Falls leak that was flooding my entire bathroom. I even had to put my kitchen´s trashcan because of the amount of water that was leaking and I was dumping the water like 3 times per day. I reported it immediately and they "came to check"... never did a single thing. One night I even got up to go to the bathroom and I fell right on my butt because it was fully flooded. I reported it like 5 more times and they always "came to check" and told me that they were still waiting for new pieces to arrive. I took videos and pictures of the incident and I was literally 1 second away of suing them because it was starting to become dangerous for me and I was honestly just tired of the whole situation as it was becoming really, really annoying. On the other hand, I do not know why nor they never ever gave me a reason, the closet in which I had my washing machine smelt REALLY bad, like something was rotten or literally an animal had died in there. I mentioned it to the staff several times but they just told me it was normal and that this smell was going on through out all the building. Oh okay, thanks I guess, this is really normal then. They told me the same thing when I literally left for one month, came back, and all the water was smelling like rotten eggs (a clear sign of high levels of sulphur). I opened all the water taps in the whole apartment for 3 hours everyday for a whole week and it was still smelling bad, I could not even drink it. Again, they told me it was "normal". As the other review mentioned, the amenities (the gym and the pool) were literally closed for an entire semester and even more when other apartment complexes were already fully opened. What was I even paying for? They should had at least given us a discount or something, like, what? Furthermore, I started realizing that the staff is usually really unprofessional and they usually treat you like they own the place without remembering that YOU are the client, they think they are superior than you just for working there. They are often rude and mean. Security also SUCKS because, first of all, people were stealing stuff ALL the time from the lobby, from chairs to the paintings that were hanging on the walls. Also, those guys were so creepy, I heard them talking about girls that walked past them all the time (not the nicest comments obviously) and they always looked at you really creepy. I honestly never felt safe when this happened and it made me extremely uncomfortable. I could also go on and on saying other bad experiences that I had but that would just make this review look like an essay. I will just conclude by saying that I cannot believe that a "luxury" apartment complex has all these problems, some of them severe, and that it is scamming their clients with their high prices compared with their poor service.”
- “Reposting since they closed the previous yelp link.  My experience was with the current ownership.   The construction will wake you early in the morning.  They do not have cameras in the garage and if you have an incident of vandalism in the garage, they won't even acknowledge it.  Local management said there wasn't anything they could do and when you try to call regional management they won't respond and only after leaving a message for the president did I get a nasty voicemail saying they won't do anything.  If you are OK waking up with the construction crew at 7am, having dust everywhere and never have an issue where you might need someone to respectfully call you back, go for it.  However I wouldn't choose Aspire again and you should think twice about sending a student to a building where someone could hide in the garage, do damage to property or individual and go unnoticed.  Play it safe.”

- “First off I want to start with the Super Inn is previously known at the Knights Inn. The receipt we got still has the Knights in printed on it. A girlfriend and I had a trip planned for Tucson last week. I had made prior arrangements a few days earlier and booked a hotel with hotels.com. I wanted to make sure we had a hotel with 24hr desk service because I knew we would be arriving late as the drive from San Diego takes about 6hrs. We arrive around 1:30am to check in. The two men behind the counter (one of them the owner) couldn't find my reservation. It took about ten minutes for them to finally find it on the printed out reservations list, even after I spelled out my name. Anyways the guy try's to put me in a smoking room when I had booked a nonsmoking room. He said he didn't have any nonsmoking rooms available. I'm already annoyed at the fact that it's taking so long to check in but now my room isn't available. He tells me to drive two hotels down to the other hotel he owns the Super Inn and they will give me a non smoking room there. So I get back in my car and drive to the next hotel. When I arrive I ask the girl behind the desk if she can give me a better rate for the first night since we are checking in so late and because of the inconvenience of having to go to another hotel. She says no. I say I want to check the hotel next door and I will be back if I can't get a room there. I didn't want to give this business any of my money because of how I've been treated already. Long story short the hotel next door was over double the price so I came back. This rude girl behind the counter checks me in and tells us "she is putting us in a remodeled room and she thinks I'll like it". Ok whatever. It's already late now and I'm exhausted from the long day, all I want is to get to the room, shower, and crash. We open the door to our room and see an ok looking bed setup but are hit with an overwhelming musty odor. I put my bags down and walk to the bathroom. There are three different kinds of dead bugs on the bathroom counter also bug poop scattered all over the sink. The sink, mirror, and wall are covered in filthy black stains like someone dropped dirty mop water all over. The shower is covered in a yellow residue and there is literally a poop stain on the toilet seat. This is the last straw for me. Since the phone in the room didn't work I had to try and find the number for the front desk since it wasn't listed anywhere. I ended up calling the first hotel and told the guy I first talked to the issue. He refused to do anything about it and I asked to speak with the owner who was there as well. He told me he already left. I demanded that he send someone to clean the room and he hangs up on me. Obviously there is no talking sense into these people so I decide to just get some sleep and will get the house keeping to come first thing when I wake up so they can clean and I can get ready. When we wake up in the morning my friend can't breath, she is choking. She literally could not breath from staying in that room. I did some more research and found the front desk number to get them to send someone to clean. The woman at the front said that she just couldn't send someone to clean it, that she didn't know where they were and it didn't work that way. I told her she needed to find someone as to these conditions are unsatisfactory and unsanitary!! She hangs up on me. I'm feeling defeated so I call hotels.com to see if there is anything I can do. They end up giving me a voucher for the first night and calling the hotel and getting them to reimburse me for the second day and that was only if I checked out. Absolutely! I wanted to get out as fast as possible. We grab all our stuff and immediately head to the front office. The woman tells me to hold on we wait fifteen minutes while she wanders around and takes other  phone calls, ignoring us. Another man comes in and asks what room we had stayed in, we told him the number and he tells the lady behind the desk no! You weren't suppose to stay in that room it's unrentable see the box around the number it's not suppose to be rented out. But offers us another room and tries everything for us to stay so they could keep our money for the second day. I want nothing to do with this place so I refuse. Hesitantly they refund my card for the second night and we leave. Finally we get to our nice hotel and I go straight to the bathroom to shower the filth of the previous hotel off. When I take off my clothes I see large bites on my back, feet and legs. Of course the previous scummy hotel would have bugs. Now I'm covered in bed bug bites. Moral of the story don't stay at The Super Inn or Western Inn. Disgusting hotel and Disgusting, lying, cheating owner and staff. I called to complain to hotels.com again after hearing they put us in an unrentable room and they put me on hold to confirm the story with the hotel.  They denied it. Like really!? What a surprise.”
- “We were looking for somewhere for the weekend, and came across this place. They took cash and it was down the street from where we had been dropped off.  From the outside, it looked ok. Typical budget place, nice pool. Checked in. Red flag one: no change for a 20...ok, luckily we had change. The key we received said Knights Inn on it. Red Flag two.  The outside smelled like cleaning products, kind of overwhelming.  We get to our room, and the walls are nasty dirty. The shower is a stand up one that resembles a pod, with some weird thing stuck to the bottom. The beds were at least clean looking, and we were tired.  Our son goes to take a shower, and when he comes out, compared it to being urinated on by a giant. The water pressure was a drizzle at best. The whatever stuck to the shower floor made his feet sticky.  The TV is from 1980. The remote only worked if you pushed it together hard. The next day, I went to sit by the pool, only to have the guy behind the counter snap at me it was closed. I asked to buy quarters for the washer, of course they didn't have any...big surprise.  I take a shower, and the thing on the floor, I discover, is just hiding a weak, broken spot after it cracked and cut my heel.  We told the housekeepers 6 times we didn't need service, and even told the office. But every hour, they still knocked.  Oh, and our key card stopped working...yippee.  We paid 69.99 a night for 2 nights, and with tax, it came up to 178...everything was just written on a piece of paper... I really wanted to like this place, but no. Don't stay here.”
- “Stay FAAAAARRRR away! You get what you pay for!  On 08/31/2019, I booked a motel stay with hotels.com at the Super Inn Tucson, AZ location for 09/01/2019 to 09/04/2019 because it seemed like I got a good deal. I arrived at the property on 09/01/2019 at approximately 10:30 pm PST to check in and pay.  Upon arriving at the motel room, I noticed that the room was wide open before entering the card key to unlock the room. With concern over safety, hygiene, and possible liability issues, I returned to the front desk. The woman/ "manager" at the front desk, Monica, appeared apathetic about the concerns I brought forth. After unsuccessfully convincing me that the room was still safe to occupy because the "cleaning ladies probably left it open," Monica offered me another, but smaller, room. I later discovered I was charged double for the motel stay, then later credited for the second charge.   I agreed to the replacement room out of desperation of not being familiar with the Tucson area and not wanting to find another motel room at 10:30 pm after a twelve plus hour car ride. This replacement room had several issues: multiple light bulbs missing from different lamps, dirty bathroom mat wrapped around single body and face towel, shower rings missing and shower curtain tattered, used men's underwear being draped on the outside balcony area in front of the front door, and dirty/used disposable ear plug covering the inside area for the door peep hole to name a few. Additionally, I was harassed by a man claiming to work for the motel who stated that he was going door to door ensuring that motel residents had adequately paid for their full stay. Ultimately, I checked out early on 09/03/2019 late evening at approximately 11:30 pm PST due to live cockroaches being found in the bathroom area.  I ended up contacting the BBB and requesting a full refund for my stay at Super Inn in Tucson, AZ due to the dirty and unsafe living conditions and the facility's inability to provide a minimally hospitable environment for paying customers.  On the bright side, I saw an actual road runner on the side of the road; he was very cute :)”

- “My 3 year old son went here for a while, they aren't very professional. They have an app where they update what happens during the day, what they eat, when they go and how they go, and nap time. But they don't always update it, and nap time even thought it gets marked down, does not actually mean your child slept that day, it's just a general scheduled nap time, and doesn't matter if your kid actually slept during that time or not. They also aren't very observant. They had added a new app where you can watch your children live throughout the day. I watched as the first day they started, a teacher left a pair of scissors out and unattended for quite a while. I saw another child almost lay their head down on that pair of scissors and so I messaged them on their other app where they update what's going on during the day letting them know. Where the teacher got reprimanded for it and I was assured it was an accident. Then another message came up, saying that we as parents are not allowed to message the app during the day with any question or comments we may have about what's going on during the day. That it bothers the teachers. On another occasion, we got a report about an accident that happened, not once but twice in the same day by the same kid. The reports we're written in two different hand writings but apparently was seen happening by the same teacher. Also they obviously didn't check where his 2 wounds were because where they told us they were, one was completely off. They said it happened on his arm and back. He had a mark on his arm, but the other one was actually on his chest. Not to mention these were bite marks. Absolutely ridiculous. After that we decided not to go back, because even with all these apps and the live stream. It was not good enough for my child. It's like paying for a babysitter with no experience but a company name.”
- “Similar to the reviewer below, our first impression of the place was not too bad, it is conveniently located, etc.  What ensued next was nothing short of an unprofessional, neglectful and apathetic treatment by the team and management.  If you want the best for your kid, which I am sure almost every parent does, think twice before heading this way, and read below.    ------   My wife stops by one day around 5pm to pick up our 13-month old boy.  When she walks in, she finds him in tears, with big bloodied scratch marks running from just underneath his left eye, down to his cheek.  His chin also was bloodied, with a piece of flesh missing.  He was sitting down in the lap of one of the employees who was trying to calm him down.  Apparently, as she claimed, the incident had just happened.  Another kid, they told us, had randomly attacked my boy by grabbing his face with his hands and biting at his chin.  The injuries they said are due to the kid's long finger nails.  Clearly, my wife was upset, and asked how could an injury happen to such an extent, with supervisors around.  Note that, as this was around 5pm, there were only around 5-6 kids in the classroom.  My wife rushed him to a nurse.    Even though my wife is more upset about how could this happen when so few kids are around, I am more concerned about what this so-called "child care" did about it: nothing.  Instead of apologizing, the staff kept telling my wife that these incidents usually happen, that the other child had long finger nails, and that this happened before with another child and no one made a fuss about it (implying we are).  I am not sure a child-care facility that brushes away responsibility like that (using careless and insensitive language) is somewhere parents want to entrust their kids with.    Case in point: no one called us to check on my kid at any point.  My wife walks in the next day to talk to the supervisors, and I go in 2 days after the incident to pick up his clothes.   In both visits, there were no apologies made, no questions about how our kid is doing, no sign of any care, with complete lack of responsibility and professionalism.  I asked about the long-nails policy (none), disinfecting wounds in such situations (none), telling us about the other kid's health history if we have anything to worry about (none).  Complete apathy.  Their only focus was to brush this as a non-event.      Even more concerning was that the management kept lying about the facts of the case.  For example, they claim that there were 13 kids in the class when this happened.  Not true.  My wife saw 5-6 kids around 5pm. Also, they claim that this happened just as my wife was coming into the nursery: wounds appeared older for sure, as the picture evidence shows. When I faced them about their response and how they handled the case with apathy, they claim that they apologized to my wife when she was picking up our kid (with a bloodied face), as if their duty was fulfilled with that one alleged apology.    The state health department was notified about this incident, and we were given advice about our rights and what the child-care had done wrong.  Enough said here.    No wonder this is the only nursery in the area that is still enrolling kids, whilst others around it have a 2-month wait period.  You know where not to place your kid now I hope.”
- “This is the worst child care I've ever put any of my kids in. First of all they allow child abuse. They are unorganized. They have no schedule really except nap time. The child to teacher ratio is always off. The staff has no support from there supervisor to help with the kids.The staff is burnt out and witness child abuse ultimately leading to them quitting constantly. There is no warmth here. Kids seriously hate it here. It's more like an institution. It's very cold. They give a false sense of security with the cameras. They are only there so you can watch your child get abused or taunted. They don't do anything about it. The worker will be on the same shift same class the next day ready put ur kids face one more time.  Every time I looked at the camera something was wrong. Wether it be my daughter asking for a snack and following a teacher around the class. The teacher refusing to give her one and begin eating the kids snacks in front of her face. This went on for about 8 min. My daughter asking her for food and her pointing her to go away and the teacher eating HER snack while my daughter watched. Or just straight pushing a kids head yanking them around by there arms in fits of anger. Pushing the little boys head. Then trying to hold his head down on the mat putting her leg over him so he couldn't move for nap time cuz he didn't want to sleep. And the other workers in there doing nothing about it. Just look away. Once I went to drop off my daughter and a teacher rushed in to tell the manager that a child had been left in a room by himself and forgotten. My daughter lasted 2 weeks here ( yes this all happened in 2 weeks) and I pulled her out and had to call the police. I have to drive further but there is such a change in her it's worth it. You can tell she's happy at her new daycare. She wasn't happy at all here she never stopped crying when dropping her off and I thought that was maybe normal... it wasn't. Day 3 at her new daycare she wasn't crying and she ran to the teacher to hold her and was like bye mom. And guess what they're not the only daycare who has cameras. If you leave your kids here like I would seriously question you as a parent if you see what's going on and think that it doesn't effect your child in a huge way it does. I know maybe another facility might be a little more expensive or a little further but I promise promise it's worth it.”

- “One of the Worst Housing rental Companies in Tucson. DO NOT RENT FROM. They will not fix anything that breaks, charge you random fees for nothing.   When they show your house they just leave a general notice sayng they may show it sometime that week and leave it everyweek on your door. Then will show it to sketch people most of whom dont even go to college. I had almost all my personal items stolen on the days that they texted me saying they were showing the house and then i called them back and they lied saying they never showed it. Yet they were the only others with keys. Had about 4000 in things taken. After I moved out i get calls being harrassed about money i owe them for random new charges for "Damages" being painted walls and a door that got kicked down one of the day they showed the house.   Threatening taking me to court after i have paid the amount initially agreed upon. Saying there were more charges that did not get added the first time. Will not stop.   DO NOT rent from them EVER. Completly unethical screwing students over every year. NELLIE is the worst of them all”
- “Casa Bonita has affordable homes for college students on a budget. Their homes are cookie cutter homes that have standard white cabinets and tile flooring. The problem was really the companies lack of respect for renters. We had requested to schedule our AC filter changes with maintenance rather than having them come in as they please. We requested this several times and would still find that maintenance men would come into our house without our knowledge. Casa Bonita argued that 48 hour time windows are appropriate warnings. Towards the end of our lease Casa Bonita would show our home to future potential renters whom would also come unannounced (sometimes Casa Bonita would TEXT us 5 minutes prior to their arrival as a warning). When we asked them to please schedule showings of our home in advance they argued that day of notification was their right. They also would continually remove the "For Rent" sign from our back yard and stake it in our front yard as marketing for their company. This resulted in a vehicle backing into the sign as the company never notified the household they were installing the sign again and again. On top of all of this they will take as much of your deposit as they can. I have rented 5 homes in my college years and Casa Bonita was the only company to take money out of my deposit. Beware of this company”
- “DO NOT RENT FROM CASA BONITA. They are unprofessional in every way. From the very beginning they got nothing done and even made me put a deposit on a house that was already rented out. Now, they have BROKEN our agreements in the lease, entered the premise WITHOUT TELLING US BEFORE OR AFTER and STOLE OUR PROPERTY. I am filing a formal complaint with the Department of Housing. These people are NOT smart enough to do their job and are kind of idiots.”

- “Management has nasty attitude. There is roaches and Ants 6 months untreated, bee infestation. Maintenance refuses to replace appliances that are broken. The maintenance men are thieves. Laundry thieves, I have to do my laundry off site. Favoritism with residents regarding rules and regulations”
- “So far Ive had good experiences with staff in the sense that they've been friendly and professional. However the management of the actual apartments is Poor and disturbing due to conditions they like to call "clean". Being in a pandemic and this being an issue only makes it a bigger concern which they've clearly shown not to care for.”
- “The manager is disrespectful, rude and they have no care for their renters. Place is infested in multiple ways. My bed was flipped upside down with all my bedding on the FLOOR when i got home from work. The notice for inspection stated it was going to be done on the 17th and two days later with no written notice come home to my bed upturned and my firearm moved!! Terrible place to live.

- “Worst customer service possible. Store is franchise owned and will not honor exchange policy on the Pandora website.”
- “Worst customer service EVER! And by the store manager... So I went into the pandora store at park mall when they had their last "spend 150 get a free bracelet" sale. The sales person said we only have one bracelet left. It happened to be the size I wanted. Perfect right??... Salesperson lays the bracelet next to me and we start finding charms. I have looked at almost every tray and have found 3 charms and I'm looking for my 4th. Just as I find it she takes the bracelet away gives it to the people across the counter from me and says " Sorry they were here first, they were just trying to decide if they wanted the bracelet. And they do now...WTH??  I have spent over 45 min picking out charms and you just now tell me this?? Now I have no bracelet, and all she says is "Sorry" are you kidding me?? I called to complain to the manager of the store only to find out it WAS the store manager who did it. I have alot of money invested in my pandora...I'm done! Terrible!!”
- “I received a Pandora bracelet as a gift in December. The Giver stated that if it was too small to take it back to Pandora and they would give me one to fit. I went back to the Pandora at Park Place instead of helping  they're rude and treated me like as if I was trying to rip them off. I would recommend going to the shop Been Bridge in La Encantada when it comes from buying Pandora products in Tucson.”

- “If there was a zero star option - I would use it. This guy is a major slum lord. I still have not received my security deposit back and he has not returned any  of my phone calls/emails. He doesn't even live in Arizona and sends random people to the rental to do his dirty work. If you want to live near the U of A area or 4th Ave; DO NOT RENT FROM JERRY EDWARDS!!!!! I really wanted to be in a fun neighborhood and kept a positive outlook on this property but it was one thing after another on 827 N Herbert Ave, Tucson, AZ- This place is not even built to code and should be inspected by the city of Tucson. I am really glad that I traveled a lot for work and did not have to be a resident for longer than a year.”
- “Total nightmare. The house we rented from Jerry Edwards was condemned by the city while we were living in it after fire shot out of the wall right next to our bed and 11-week-old baby. Of course, he had no interest in giving us our deposit back, and didn't listen to us when we complained about issues such as black mold behind the tub and strange electrical surges. The inspector was on the property for about 5 minutes before he condemned it. This man is a total slumlord - BEWARE. His cheapness left us homeless with a baby and could have killed us.”
- “Do not rent from Jerry Edwards. A landlord of no scruples, he will violate state law and keep your deposit. I am currently taking him to small claims court, and I'm sure that even with a judgment against him, it will be a hassle to track him down for my money. (But it will be worth it to seek justice.) Throughout a lease's term, he is similarly negligent; we rented from him for five years because we loved the location, but we had various problems due to his mismanagement or negligence, most notably a broken hot water heater that wasn't replaced for over a month in the winter. He hires incompetent people to do shoddy repairs. On multiple days, his employees turned off the water to "fix" the units behind us without any notice.  It is clear from multiple online reviews that he has stolen funds from many tenants. I hope that others will hold this man accountable. By state law, a landlord has 14 business days to remit a deposit or to furnish an itemized list of damages. If the landlord fails to do so, a tenant is entitled to sue for the deposit plus damages of twice the deposit. Do not let Jerry Edwards continue to prey upon his tenants with impunity.”

## Tips from customers
I own a property next to one of his.  He rents to dodgy people. The police helicopters are always flying over looking for the illegal activity that's always happening on his property. His property has been raided three times this year.  It's drug dealer after drug dealer. This guy is a real weasel. The windows are all broken out and boarded up. Trust me, that's how he'll try to rent it most-likely. 
     If you like slimey, sleezy, unkept, third-world squalor, then you'll love his properties.

- “I placed an order may 21st for products for my salon. I called after 2 weeks and was reassured I would have my order within a couple of weeks and they were running behind due to covid-19. I have been more than understanding but after waiting this long I either need my supplies or I need my money back so I can purchase form another company. They refused a refund. They have good products if you can ever get them. Our salon will never purchase from then again.”
- “Over FORTY days since I've placed my order. They keep using the "EXCUSE" of Covid as an opportunity to take advantage of paying customers. If you check the Better Business Bureau you will see an F rating and 20 complaints in the last several months. Don't do business with the company and Max, he's an opportunistic swindling customers and exploiting them using Covid.”
- “I placed an order 7/15 and have not received it.  I've emailed with no response, this company is not fulfilling their orders but they are still taking folks money.  There are no updates regarding where your order is.  No where on the site can you confirm where they are with your order.  They do not allow you cancel the order and they do not give refunds.  They claim the delays are due to COVID which is a lie since this is a common practice of this company which you can confirm by the numerous complaints from other consumers.  At this point I feel duped, bamboozle, scammed and this company should be held accountable for their poor business practice.  They are taking peoples money and not giving them what they bought.  MY ADVICE..DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!!  Spend your money somewhere where they appreciate the business.”

- “Ive stayed with this place because I liked the drs that I have seen. My cardiologist thought I had sleep apnea. I said I'm on a cpap machine    He said you need to see that dr again. So I called Catalina chest told him what cardiologist said. I get a message back they said was from dr. "Stop useing cpap and the y scheduled  an appointment three months out " two months later ofFice calLed and asked if I reaally needed to see dr. I said yes. They said ok and hung up. Days before appointment they canceled my appointment and offered a tentative appointment for June. I said no. I want a firm appointment time like every other dr gives.   Unbelievable! Run away from this place”
- “I went here for sleep paralysis that were severe enough that I basically wasn't getting restful sleep at all, which obviously is unhealthy and very unsettling. U of A health center referred me here since this is about the only sleep specialist in Tucson that I (or the health center) am aware of. Anyways, they immediately put me on a medication (can't remember what it was called) but it did nothing so they switched me to Sertraline (Zoloft). Which ended up not working and caused me to feel lazy. They assured me that withdrawals were basically non-existent and put me on a low dose. I tapered VERY slowly off the lowest dose of the drug and I'm still experiencing withdrawals 3 months later. Maybe I'm the odd case, but I wish they made this more clear and had exhausted all other possibilities before diving straight into psychoactive drugs. I also wish they made it easier to contact the doctor (maybe an email address or something...?) so I could relay my experience to help them with treatment planning without paying for an appointment.”
- “I called five times to schedule an appointment with Dr. Chacko.   First they told me that the fax number my primary care physician used was incorrect but it's the fax number listed on their website.   My PCP sent their referral to the number given to me by Kelly and when I called again and left a voice  message with the scheduler, she never returned my call.  Called again a day later and spoke to Kelly who was going to contact the scheduler herself and have her call me.    Still waiting.    While Carolotta was the lucky one who secured an appt., the number of one star reviews indicates an abyssmal scheduling policy for CCC”

- “Don't bother banking here if you do shared branching with another credit union. They discontinued it August 1. Really not worth going to credit union anymore.”
- “Terrible customer service. I was shopping refinancing rates for my new Tacoma, TFCU had the best rate by a fraction, decided to give them a try. First off, I had to reach out to even find out the terms / rate after a vague approval email, then spent over a week and multiple times trying to get ahold of someone / my loan officer via email and phone to no answer. Was promised by their customer service department here on Facebook someone would call me (twice), never a single phone call or follow up. Sorry but no customer should have to chase a bank down for their business, what a joke. Look at other reviews, save your time and go somewhere else.”
- “Look at the review that I posted for the Speedway branch. It applies to all of TFCU. I have been with them for 8 months and consistently have trouble getting money from the ATMs. I have given up even trying and just go to the store for cash back from purchases. I wasted and hour of thee mornings in a row trying to send money with their Zelle app and not only failed to get it sent, my Zelle account is now locked. A "supervisor" who tried to fix it over the phone said that she would call me back at 9 am the next day and didn't. If I had read the online reviews of these people before I would never have made this mistake. This morning I am going in to get a cashiers check for everything i have with them and taking it to SunWest credit union. Maybe they will make my money more accessible.”

Bottom line do not work for, contract with or help this company in any way, let them fail, like they should, bad buisness who works their employees as slaves, look at the reviews on indeed or any other site.”
- “Would have scored zero rating don't work here or purchase anything from this calling center. They take advantage of coworkers and they commit fraudulent acts such as not paying employees, taking commission,and make you feel like it's fault your loosing commission because you didnt try hard enough,  there was always something I sold 177 cellphones that retailed at $1000and got paid 250$ commission like at my calculations they gave me a 1.5 percent commission and divided my money to all the managers don't work here or ever buy anything from websites online with option to chat with a sales chat rep. The money may be intriguing but in reality your only making minimum wage with no holidays off expect to work thanksgiving after being told your off for all holidays complete liars work here.”
- “Part 1 (Read other parts on the added photos) :  So, I have waited a little while to write this review because I wanted to get over my initial anger & calm down so I could write about my experience with this place a bit more rationally. I have not changed my position on one thing- do NOT, I repeat do NOT work here. This place will literally suck the life out of you.   I got hired last January & initially did like it. Training was fun, I got along great with my team & we all formed real friendships. Many of whom I still talk with to this day so I guess that is one thing I am actually thankful for from this place. I got put into the Progressive project & my coach was Carlton. I actually didn't have any problems with Carlton as a person & I think he is a hard-working coach. But there were some things he did at times that definitely weren't things I agreed with. One of the things was writing me up on the day that he KNEW my cat died. Afni preached empathy but rarely showed it to their employees. I was literally crying at my desk & he knew about it but still chose that day to write me up when he could have waited until the next day to do so. I actually left early that day because I felt so disrespected. Another thing, I will be the first to admit I had problems with their strict attendance policies. I hated working there so I called out a lot & eventually had to be put on written contract to not miss anymore days. Something I followed & didn't get in trouble for again since I missed no other days since being put on the contract up until I stopped working there. But the day before I was put on contract was the last time I called out & his behavior that day was unprofessional. I had taken an approved leave of absence earlier that year & my dad went in with me to help me with the process. Because of that reason they had my dad's contact information. Well, on the last day I had called out Carlton actually called MY dad to basically tell on me. Mind you, I am 26 years old & this was my place of employment not my father's. Then when I confronted Carlton about this & how I found it unprofessional he straight up lied & tried to say he never called my dad & only called my  personal number that was on file. I had screenshots of him calling my dad which I was planning on providing since we had to have a meeting with HR about it. At the meeting it turned into "We only care about you & wanted to make sure you were okay that day." Point blank, my father should have never been contacted period.   Working in the Progressive project was the worst time of my life. Progressive has this reputation of being overly-saturated "nice" because of Flo being its mascot. Because of that we were taught to be the fakest nice possible. However, 75% of Progressive customers are the worst people imaginable. They are the most entitled, rudest people who we were expected to just continue to be the fakest type of nice to. That's all good & well as it IS a customer service job. But when you are being called every cuss word in the book & being told you are stupid over & over again, of course that starts to affect you. My self-esteem while working at Afni was the worst it had ever been. Being screamed at on the daily with coaches just straight up NOT caring about you & your well-being was so tough. It weighed heavily down on not just me but all of my coworkers. Management did nothing to stop it or even try to show they were there for us. We were only told over & over again how important are numbers are & that's about it. I truly learned nothing from this job. It was the biggest waste of my time & it surely will be the biggest waste of yours if you are unfortunate enough to get hired there.”

- “Very fast response time and efficient safe removal. I was impressed. Tom Martin of AAA is a bee scientist - he is very knowledgeable and took the time to explain the difference between our native bees and the Africanized bees that must be exterminated by law. In fact Tom WROTE the law. He's great. His company is great.  I highly recommend them. When possible, his team saves the native bees which can be saved and move them appropriate places to pollinate. Call these guys first!”

- “I called them to investigate bees on my rental property. They said it would be a $95 call fee and that it would be applied to the treatment. They said they would call with an estimate. That never happened...and they billed my credit card $395 - TWICE. So I got charged $790.  I called them to dispute the double charge and was told it would be taken care of. They haven't corrected it and now don't answer the phone.  They are unprofessional, at best.  Dishonest,more likely.  My next call is to the BBB.”
- “The bee removal (I'd asked for relocation of the bees) service responded very quickly - within 2 hours of my call to exterminate the bees.  The very competent technician was there approx. 1 hour, for which I was charged $600. WAY overpriced for the very little that was accomplished.  There was a mess remaining, and holes in the stucco, which I've had to hire a contractor to come repair.  Shop around, I'm sure there are other bee exterminators who will do the job for much less. The manager, Tom, will tell you there's a coupon that he'll double.....which just means that he was going to charge you $695, but gave you a 'deal' by charging you ONLY $600.  I won't call them again.”
- “Shut this place down; an excuse for a service like this doesn't deserve to stay in business.  The only reason why I'm even giving them a single star is because there is no option for giving them none. If I could, I'd give them negative five, because the service is that terrible with all of their deceit and profanity.  DO NOT give them your credit card information. They will charge it immediately and you will have to dispute anything else after that. It was such a hassle and I literally had to fight them in order to get absolutely nothing. It was outrageous! I called and left messages, they never called me back, and I wasted my time even speaking to them because they were so strongly unwilling to deal with any suggestions for better service and customer satisfaction.  We spoke to a man named Tom, who is probably the most unprofessional, uncompromising, and unconditionally the most insolent and repulsive man I have ever met. I called him for the third time regarding a beehive removal, and when he insisted that I was on speaker phone - which I was not - he hung up immediately and refused to talk to me until I "get off the speaker phone." His way of dealing with business is perhaps the most child-like and repulsive method I have ever seen, and he will make up any kind of excuse to dodge disputes and blame; what's worse is that he is extremely unwilling to make any sort of compromise to satisfy his customers. He is, for the lack of a better term, the epitome of a vile, degrading little asshole.  But wait, there's more.  Charging almost $900 dollars to remove a beehive is practically giving them an arm and a leg, so you'd think that they'd be a bit for flexible in terms of customer service. However, their thick skulls and their massive, disgusting egos refuse to back down from any sort of compromise, and they enforce it with the stupidest and lamest excuses. We got our beehive removed from another place for UNDER $200, and the man we spoke to there was one of the most pleasurable people to associate with. This place is absolutely no comparison to anywhere else, and we will not hesitate to turn our noses on them even if their services went down for free.  It's utterly and absolutely ridiculous. Call the police. This place robs your wallet and is shameless enough to flaunt it in your faces. HIGHLY dissatisfied and we would rather perish waist-deep in these so-called "Africanized bees" than call this shithole again.”

- “Never have had a problem with the Doctor's. However it is with the office staff! I can never get an appointment when needed. I called several days in a row at 8am for a sick appointment and hold for 20+ mins just to be told they have nothing available. My 6 month old ended up in the emergency room due to respiratory issues. The ER doctor said to absolutely follow up with his PCP in one day. I called for the appointment and expressed the urgency of needing to be seen and the said sorry nothing available call again tomorrow. Even with the circumstances they refused to schedule out an appointment to be seen. They said that's not possible. I called today for my daughter due to he eczema flare up and they said I had to call in the morning for an appointment that it is considered a sick appointment and cannot be scheduled out. Then they call later to cancel the appointment because of scheduling conflicts, I said forget it! I told the lady on the phone my complaint of being dissatisfied and possibly looking for an new doctor her response was sorry for the inconvenience,have a nice day. Unbelievable! This office has no sense of urgency or care for the children or there well being. I will never recommend this place and I will not be returning!”
- “this place is awful. Money is their main priority, not the care of your child. I will never bring my kids back to this place and I recommend you don't either”
- “Since there are no reviews on here, I thought one was in order. After moving to Tucson I decided to take my infant to the office on north Oracle road because of the location and staff size; I could have not been more displeased. Her first visit was a sick visit; not only did I wait two hours past her appointment time with zero staff member's apologizing or assuring me I'd be seen shortly (I stayed because I was going to get charged either way) but then had Dr joos ask me why I was there, why I brought her in for a wet cough and was completely nonchalant about my waiting time and why I was there. I look young and possibly as if I don't know anything but I have two grad degrees and absolutely love being treated like a moron rather than a concerned first-time parent. Second visit a few days later was a well check, hour past appointment time and different doc. I couldn't get a word in at all, the shot tech was possibly brand new and I left with zero questions answered. I would never recommend them.”

- “No pressure sales. Pleasantly surprised that I did business at a dealer. Very pleased with the service I received from them and very pleased with my purchase.  I dealt with Mike, the sales manager, who really worked with me on price and financing. José and his partner, Mark, were great guys. I didn't feel any pressure from them at all to buy a car. You know, getting cornered into an office, feeling like you are being backed into a wall, getting offers that you can't refuse, etc. Now I wasn't sure I was going to buy this car because it literally was the very first AND the only car I test drove. I can't tell you how this completely violates my M.O. on purchasing things. I'm a really good comparison shopper and my family and friends depend on me to major and even minor purchases. So I was extremely hesitant to buy this car even though it seemed that it was everything I wanted.   And to make it even enticing, even though the car's book value was $8k, Mike said he would sell it to me for my asking price of $6k. But then the payments were too large, even with my down payment. I started to look elsewhere. José then kind of bugged me with texts asking if I would buy the car if we got the payments to where I wanted them. I hedged. Again because I still hadn't test drove any other cars. He said to at least come in and give it one more test drive before I dismissed it. I relented and decided to bring my wife with me so she could drive it, too.   Now here's the good part: They just got this car in on a trade. They take the trades into the service department where they inspect the car and give it a full detail job. They do want to sell a car that is in good shape. In this car, they replaced a strut. This made the car ride even smoother than before. I decided to buy it. Mike got my payments way down to where I wanted them to be. I gave them a list of everything I wanted fixed before I took possession. They duplicated the fob and extra key, replaced the bad hydraulic hood support rod, replaced a cabin bulb, fixed the courtesy dome lights so that they would perform like they were supposed to, and fix the errant tire pressure monitor. They did everything. I thought that was impressive.  Mike, José, and Mark are easy to work with and easy to talk with. Mike is a down to earth guy that has been in this business for a long time. It seems that he has great used car deals on his lot. If I had another $10k I would have bought that really nice Jaguar sports car that was priced several thousand below book.  Yes, people, I'm actually recommending that you go to this dealer.   5* = A top favorite. Mind-blowing good. I will definitely return and I will go out of my way to go here. Worth every dime of my money.  4* = Outstanding. Tucson-top-tier. Some elements not quite as good as it gets, but it still is worthy of my regular business.  3* = Good experience. I might do repeat business if it is convenient, the only option, the only one in its category, or on a whim, but would not be among the first thing to come to mind. Would definitely recommend you trying it to get your own take on it.  2* = Not so good. Would not recommend at all. Waste of money.  1* = How are they still in business? Stay away at all costs!”

- “I wish I could give Quebedeaux a better rating, but since all their sales people seem to have disappeared today, here we are, giving an honest rating on our experience.    We were out shopping for a new vehicle today.  My husband really likes the Mitsubishi Outlander, so we stopped to look at the one on the lot because we were very interested in it.  First of all, no window sticker, so that's not cool.  I like to know up front if a particular model is in our price range and the options on it.  We walked around the SUV for a few minutes, checking out the outside and looking in the windows.  My husband tried the door and found the vehicle unlocked, so at least we were able to sit in the front and back seats, open the tailgate, check out storage, spare tire and the options we could see with the car turned off.    We assumed a salesperson would eventually show up, especially since there was another car sitting there, running, driver door wide open and dealer plate on.  I seriously thought about driving it around the parking lot to see if ANYONE would come outside but I didn't.    We were there for quite some time and there was nobody in the lot.  Someone at least could have popped outside and said someone will help us in a bit but nope.  We finally left and went to Thoroughbred Nissan and purchased a new Rogue SL.  I guess Quebedeaux doesn't care if they sell cars.”
- “I bought a new Mitsubishi Mirage here. Felt pressured to buy this tiny vehicle due to current affordability - salesman (Dan) made it seem like this is the best I could do.  We test drove the vehicle and he offered me an amazing deal, but I went home.  He called me the next day and said that finance was able to lower the monthly payment.  I drove back to the dealership with the understanding that all of the paperwork would be ready upon my arrival, as I was visiting there during my lunch hour.  Dan failed to mention that they changed the loan terms from 60 months to 80, and they tacked on extra's - two warranties and loan insurance, as if my credit score of 680 required it.    I'm finally refining my vehicle to lower the payment by almost $80 per month.  I recommend to get your own financing and read all the loan details before buying from here.”
- “Had been in contact with the dealership regarding a BMW X5 for a few days and made a 2 pm appointment to visit the dealership on Wednesday, March 9 for a test drive   As I live about 100 miles away I called at 12 noon on day of appointment to verify that the vehicle was still on the lot.     Was assured it was still available and received a confirmation text from the dealership verifying above shortly after our phone conversation.    Arrived at dealership after a a 90 minute drive - and was advised that the car I was interested in seeing was sold the day before but " we have others".  I just turned around and left.   Highly Irritated at them for wasting my time especially since I had already arranged purchase details with my credit Union.   In looking at other reviews On this dealership,  I see this is not the first complaint on this same subject.    Not interested in dealing with bait and switch tactics.    Buyer beware.”

Hours are 40+ guaranteed but sick time and pto hours are not always available for you your boss will use that when your late without letting you know. Hr dept is even worse does not care about their employees at all. They do not care if you have a doctors note it will count against you regardless. DO NOT WORK HERE”

- “I went to Panda at Park Place on Sunday, April 28, 2019 with my 3 granddaughters.  It was about 13 minutes before closing time and the food was looking "not so fresh" especially the fried rice, which I guess is to be expected since it was so late.  The two girls working the line/cashier were not very friendly.  Both looked really unhappy and lackluster.  It took a few minutes for the 1st girl to stop sweeping to look at us (she didn't even wash hands or change gloves) and help.  The girl didn't really pay attention to us we had to repeat our requests a few times.  She was very distracted.  I can really only eat the teriyaki chicken and there was only a little left.  I asked for it anyway, and when I got to the cashier I asked for a discount as I barely had any chicken.  She just looked at me and didn't reply.  When I asked are you going to give me a discount she said "I already did - 10%", which in my opinion wasn't enough for a small amount of chicken.  Anyway, she didn't once smile or seem welcoming.  I asked to speak to the manager and she went in the back and came out a few minutes later and said "the manager said I'm in charge".  What a joke.  Anyway, the attitude of the staff was such I was wondering if beatings were regularly handed out by management.  I know it was closing time - but close if you don't want to serve anyone!  Take off the lackluster food and don't try to sell it!  I will think twice about eating at Panda at the mall in the future.”
- “I waited for 10 minutes just to order then i waited for 30 minutes to get my food and it was cold   would not recomend  try street tacos  next door they are fast and the food is good”
- “I got cream cheese ragoons and no sauce!!!!! Really got home and no sweet and sour. I know I should have checked my bag! It's the same girl always messing up! Also I had more noodles than anything! Ugghhh why do I waste my money here”

Veggies, Orange Chicken Had the Shangai Angus Steak with chow mein Horrible! Beef and broccoli, had no sauce and tasted disgusting.

- “I adore this woman! She is always prompt in getting back to me with test results and I can always get her to call me back if I have a question.    It is hard to find endocrinologists in town and she is one of the best. I would see her even if she didn't take my insurance.”

- “Because of her neglect, her promises on treatments which never happened even though I have insurance, I ended up with a thyroid storm hospitalized in agony for a week, suffering for 3 weeks before my husband carried me into emergency.  I have left her care and found an endocrinologist who cares about his patients.  Not one that causes harm and near death.  Her disrespect for patients is appalling I guess she missed the class in bedside manner.   And also the class on how to present ones self as a Doctor of Medicine I WAS LUCKY TO GET AWAY WITH MY LIFE.”
- “Maris' staff scheduled appointment. Called early that morning and canceled due to emergency. Fine, rescheduled fo 2/8/18, 11:15. I showed up ten minutes early. First appointment with her but was told no paperwork needed prior to appointment. Great. So 11:15 comes & goes. 11:30 comes and goes. 11:45 comes & goes. Meanwhile lunch gets delivered from various locations & drinks from somewhere else. 12:00 comes & goes. At 12:10 I ask if this delay is normal. Response: this is more than usual. There are STILL THREE PEOPLE AHEAD OF ME AND I AM 55 minutes past my appointment‼‼‼ No breakfast & it is now lunch time. I told receptionist I was leaving and would NOT be back (OBVIOUSLY‼). Dr. has a sign posted that said if you're a new patient and do not show up,  there's a $60 charge. I'm going to send the doctor a bill for $60 because she was a no-show for my appointment‼ If you want to waste your time with a doctor that doesn't mind being rude by failing to keep her appointments, then by all means try to get into see her. But if you don't like a rude doctor, check the Yellow Pages or on YELP for other endocrinologists that might give an ounce of care to their patients or want to be a new patient.   I'll come back and post if the doctor fails to pay the $60 bill for being a no-show‼‼‼”
- “Unless you like waiting between 45 minutes to 1.5 hours waiting for your appointment, find someone else. On one visit an hour past my appointment had gone by and no doctor. I stepped out in the hall and saw her in her office on her  talking to her kids who were in the office while she was playing on her cell. On another appointment, a lady had already been there an hour past her appointment time when I arrived. We watched a lady bring a coffee to the doctor, and then she didn't leave for 30 minutes! She was back there taking to the doctor while we waited in the lobby. This was the last straw for me. I'd been seeing Dr. Posadas for three years, but you don't disrespect your patients time like that.”

- “Sunset Vista Apts. Only cares about the almighty dollar! I have lived here 3 years and there has been 4 managers. They say they are pet friendly but there isnt any grass and unless the residents take care of the watering of the grounds, everything would be dead. There is homeless people that come onto the property at night because there is large holes in the fence . Alot of drug activity! The new manager this month, Stephanie came to my apt. to yell at me and tell me to get rid of my patio table and barbeque. I had never even met her before. She was so rude!!! There is alot of retired people that live here, the owner keeps raising the rent and water every year. Dont move here!!!”
- “All I can say about this place now don't rent here this place has totally gone downhill building 3 is full of roaches Building 5,7,9,11,15, has bugs also building 17 has bed bugs this place has totally gone down hill sorry to say also the management over there they have running this place oh wait a minute that's right they don't have no manager there right now this place is just totally gone downhill 579  a month that's ridiculous and they give you free Direct TV what a joke just to get you here . upset tenants there now , that they're moving out all the time”
- “If I could rate these apartments a zero, I would. Let's start off by saying I moved into a newly renovated/remodeled apartment. I was willing to pay the premium as I was expecting to move into an apartment that looked like nobody had lived in it before. I was completely wrong. The remodel was done so half-assed, rushed and terrible. They replaced the cabinets, carpet and vinyl flooring but left the drywall throughout the apartment looking horrible. Giant cracks on multiple walls, a lot of water damage in the drywall in the bathroom, random holes everywhere with horrible patch jobs. Floors uneven, floor creaks anytime you step anywhere. Didn't even bother to replace the baseboard in the bathroom to match the rest of the apartment. Instead of replacing the tub and tile surround, they covered the tile surround with a cheap plastic to hide what's behind it. Shower head and faucet trim were detached from wall. New bathroom and closet doors wouldn't even shut when I first moved in due to them not being put in correctly. Popcorn ceiling removed everywhere except the bedroom and closet. As for management, they all seem to be incompetent. In the almost year that I've been here, there have been at least 3 property mangers. None seem to know what they're doing and may or may not respond to your emails and/or phone calls. My hours were cut back in December, so I applied for rental assistance. During the entire review process for assistance, I kept in contact with the office to ensure that i would not be evicted. Once I was approved for assistance, I sent the approval email to the front office so they would know that payment was on its way. I was told by management that once the check was received from Pima County, I would not have to worry about anything and that I would not have to worry about any late fees I accrued. I thought everything was taken care of. We're now 5 months later and I get a letter on my door stating that I owe $295 in late fees.  That my rental assistance only covered the rent and not the late fees. Problem with that is that I was told that I would not have to worry about any late fees. Whole time I owe these late fees that I was told I wouldn't have. Don't tell your tenant not to worry about late fees and then charge late fees. Altogether, I have had a terrible time living here and cannot wait for my lease to end next month. Apartments are overpriced and extremely tiny and not worth the headache. STAY AWAY.”

- “Horrible customer service In the Electronic Dept! Some salt n pepper haired guy that works in this dept. is ALWAYS ON THE PHONE! Never putting customers first! I spent almost 45 mins waiting on him last time. Again today he's on the phone!! He doesn't have the courtesy to call for help he just looks at you ignores you and continues on the phone!!! Useless....”
- “This review is specifically for the Auto Center. To start off, had I not been desperate to get a new battery, I would never have left my car to be serviced here. I arrived around 6:15pm on a rainy evening. I understand it was close to closing, but like I said, I was desperate for a new battery. I pulled up and got out of my car and spoke with the first person I saw (who I did not have any issues with). He was quiet but pleasant enough and said they could change my battery. As I waited for further instructions, another employee (who I later found out was named Art) incredibly rudely told me I couldn't stand in the shop and would need to leave. As it was raining I expected him to tell me where I could go to continue checking in my car, but that didn't happen right away. After standing in the rain Art finally told me that I could go around and pointed to an opening for customers. Once in the customer designed area Art slowly began the check-in process. He could not have been more displeased at my presence and made that clear. I was polite and answered his questions until I could no longer understand what he was asking me. He was walking around my car, mumbling the questions barely audible over the rain and other employees working on other cars I had to ask him to repeat himself four times. If someone had to ask me four times to repeat myself I would change my tone and make sure they could hear me. But alas, Art didn't feel that this was necessary. At the end of the check-in process Art, again, mumbled something under his breath as he handed me a ticket. I stood there, having no clue what he said, until my boyfriend (who was next to me and witnessed the entire event unfold) had to tell me what Art had attempted to tell me, which was that they would call me when the car was ready. As we walked away to go run a quick errand before coming back, Art could clearly be heard muttering to himself, "f***ing customers....."  When we arrived back to pick up the car it was not ready and we waited inside. Art clearly was not happy we were back. Another employee rang us up (again I had no problems with this employee either) and she informed us that Art would be bringing in the keys as she handed me the receipt. As we waited we saw the Auto Center manager walk by (we had identified him earlier when we dropped the car off, and again as we returned by his picture posted in the Auto Center waiting area). Art again very rudely approached us and asked to see the receipt before giving me the keys back. Funny, how this wasn't the case with the customer who had checked out behind me, his keys were handed over to him without hesitation. Art rudely said, "sorry sir I have to verify it." Well apparently that verification process is only true with certain customers. My boyfriend then asked Art if we could speak with a manager, to which Art replied, "he's not here anymore." We verified that there was no manager present, at all, in the entire store, to speak to and Art told us no. On the drive home my boyfriend called the store and was magically able to get ahold of an assistant manager who gave him information about when he could call back to speak with the Auto Center manager. Needless to say, this was a horrible experience and I will never return to this store, especially the Auto Center. It's too bad that one bad employee can cause customers to not return. I will also be informing my friends and family to avoid this store like the plague. If I treated a customer the way Art treated me, I would be fired in a minute.”
- “Long long waits, surly staff, irritated Pharmacists over phone and in person. If you happen to have a pain prescription from your doctor you are automatically a criminal.”

- “DO NOT do business with them. PLEASE do yourself a favor. Very bad and shady business. From the dealership to their financial services ALL BAD.”
- “Cactus Jack's should be ashamed of themselves! For the past 8 months, I've witnessed my good friend, Ruby H, be handed horrible customer service, to the point I'm personally convinced she's being scammed by this dealership. As of this review, she is on her second lemon from this lot. When the first presented more problems than it was worth, including needing an engine replacement, the dealership suggested an even trade for the truck she currently has. It really was an even trade, a lemon for a lemon. This truck didn't even last 1 week before needing service. Since then, it's been one issue after another. Now the truck won't run, and the general manager has done nothing to make things right.   Cactus Jack's company mission is to help people repair their bad credit, yet they are taking advantage of those in need and charging ridiculous amounts for repairs they shouldn't have to make or are incapable of making correctly the first time. This directly contradicts their stated mission, and they deserve to be held accountable, either by the corporate office, or by us, the public. Do not give Cactus Jack's any of your time or money. They will sell you a lemon, charge you for repairs, and do nothing to actually help you. Do yourself a favor, and go to a reputable local dealer instead.  As for Cactus Jack's, if you're reading this, you need to contact Ruby, and do everything in your power and at your own expense to correct all the indefensible mistakes you've made with her thus far. Make it right!”

- “I experienced excellent customer service during ordering and installation was superb. Technician, Mike, was an excellent problem solver in connecting both tvs with prime channels and internet. Think great offerings on cable.”
- “I've had to deal with xfinity twice recently.  The first time was when I got a "no video display" message.  I had 2 HDMI cords hanging off the back.of the tv and no picture.  I only needed one, but after 30 minutes of fiddling with it, no difference.  Repair guy scheduled to come out in 2 days. Gal I spoke with initially called me back the next day and had a fix for me in 3 minutes!  Unheard of!  Not.only did that save me $40, but an afternoon of waiting for a repair guy.  I'm still smiling.  The 2nd time the volume of the tv was at 100 and nothing worked with the remote despite new batteries, rebooting, unplugging.  I called and xfinity and it only took a few minutes to realize the dog was sleeping on the original tv remote, which took presidence over my xfinity remote.  What a relief!!!”
- “Not sure where to begin .... I'm an Xfinity customer for quite a long time formerly in Florida now Tucson. As a physician my internet and landline are VERY IMPORTANT. Long story short: both went out 12 times in 3 weeks. I finally get through to someone with a heartbeat after listening to and being interrogated by that annoying recording ... it took 47 minutes!!!! Rep than gets disconnected THREE TIMES transferring me to a supervisor. I call back AGAIN ho through it all Over again! I demand to speak to a supervisor. I'm finally given an appointment two days later I'm told I need a new modem DEFINITELY by the supervisor ...  Tech shows up NO MODEM ON HIS TRUCK !!! Tells me he was never advised to bring a modem. I demanded he call & set up appointment again ... he does for the following afternoon. He was in my place 3 minutes !  A tech by the name of WILL shows up on time and I explain my problem ... he states well let me first look outside at the wiring .. upon returning he tells me no it's NOT THE MODEM IT WAS DUE TO FAULTY WIRING!  TELLING ME SHORTLY EVERYONE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WOULD BE EVENTUALLY HAVING  THE SAME PROBLEM !  WILL checks everything out just to be sure. This all could have been avoided if the tech from the day before did his job! WILL than follows up with 3 phone calls to make sure everything is working!!!!!! The company needs more technicians like WILL. He told me he has been with the company a long time. The supervisor I spoke to honestly could care less the first technician was in a hurry and relieved he had zero work to do apparently but NOT WILL. He takes his job & responsibilities very serious ... HE SHOULD BE THE SUPERVISOR because he cares. The company needs more people like him. Plus get rid of that annoying ultra annoying recording....  WHOEVER HIRED WILL ..... SMART MOVE !”

- “If you live near the castle adobes area in tucson, so all you can to avoid comcast. Their infrastructure is ancient, app is broken, service is sub par, all the typical things you hear about bad cable companies is true of the local service here.   If you don't play video games a high skill level daily, or are not a content creator on the internet, or don't need fast speeds for constant downloads, just bite the bullet and get centurylink or hughes net. Slower speeds but infinitly more reliability.   I hate how often my internet just refuses.to work correctly for an hour straight, and after months and months of trying to get comcast to do something about it, it has only gotten worse. If I didn't game as much as I do, I'd leave them in a heartbeat”
- “We were planning to switch to Comcast, they came out to set up our service but said that the had to run cable to the house and that would not be until 3 weeks later.  However, they ported our phone from our service so we are without home.  This is an impossible situation and the company is unable to restore our service.  The one star is probably more then they deserve.”
- “Can I give a zero stars rating?? The customer service isn't the issue. They try. The SERVICE AND CONNECTIVITY requires at least weekly calls because of service interruptions. Don't even think to use web apps through Xfinity internet because the internet connection is horrible. Why do I pay so much for cable/internet/security!!!??? For this?”

Terrible internet connection at all times. Slowest provider I've ever had.

- “The measure of a good doctor is not only how much he/she knows, but how willing he/she is willing to listen.   Since we were referred to Dr. Duarte by a neighbor, my husband has been singing his praises. He is the third family practitioner (three times is the charm!) we've had in our two years in Tucson.    So. A situation cropped up this week that tested that relationship. My husband was hospitalized for symptoms he'd related to related to Dr. Duarte. Dr. Duarte had (I believe, correctly) referred him to a cardiologist. But still, I chose to accompany my husband into his office visit, with my internet research clutched in my sweaty palm.  I prayed (yes, seriously!) that the doctor would at least listen to me. So, so many (come on, way too many) doctors tune you out if you say the word internet. I get it. I do!  But Dr. Duarte took a few moments to scan my printouts. He left the exam room for a few minutes and when he came back, he endorsed the internet info and suggested we see the appropriate specialist.   The story is probably far from over yet. But right we feel we're on the right road.”

- “Very unorganized office, every staff member looks angry and not personable to patients, but light up when the drug reps ask what they want for lunch.  Dr Duarte doesn't even look at you, keeps his back to you and then runs out as soon as he can.  There are better Dr's in Tucson.”
- “Should you be searching for a "primary care physician" who will barely acknowledge your presence in the exam/consultation room, will sit with his back to you the entire time you're attempting to communicate with them and then will just dismiss you as a patient because they realize that perhaps they made a mistake then I highly recommend Dr. Duarte. Personally  I would like to see his license revoked.                  I was a patient of Dr. Duarte for @ 7 years.”
- “One the the WORST experiences with a "physician" I've ever had. After waiting 45 minutes past my appointment time with no reason or apology, I met with Dr. Duarte who not only spent less than 5 minutes with me and was incredibly condescending, but did not listen to half of my concerns and answered none of my questions, I then left and had to call daily for a week to get medications called in and a month later and I'm STILL trying to get ahold of someone to tell me my lab results!!! I'd have better luck at an ER.”

On top of everything running smoothly on a daily basis today I was even more impressed with this facility when I booked a condo in Mexico over the phone and within 15 minutes my bank was calling concerned that maybe my identity/Visa had been stolen.  They made me verify some information including my last few purchases and really made sure to double check everything was ok AND assured me my card would continue to work as normal, there would be no gaps in service.  I was surprised and very pleased.  Makes me even happier that I left the national chains behind.”

- “DO NOT Bank with TFCU!!! Steer clear! Do NOT pass go! Stay away from these swindlers. I opened an account, thinking I would use this financial institution, and due to moving around and leaving Tucson, I forgot about my account. When I uncover a bit of money unaccounted for in my records, I find that it is in TFCU.  Naturally I attempt to access my account online... no dice! When I call into the CU (credit union), they tell me that fees, due to inactivity, were assessed, and that'is where my money went. They sent "snail mail" to an old address, which had been forwarded, but they do not send mail to forwarded addresses. Hmm! My other banks have no problem doing this. But anyway, moving on.  So... for a bit more than a year passes, as this CU (acting just like BIG BANKS) assesses fees every month, my money was siphoned - I was robbed, basically. As I speak with a supervisor, I was told just what the telephone teller told me - "There's nothing we can do at this point". I stated that sending mail, snail mail, not emailing or trying to call me is doing "bare minimum", and if I owed them money, they would've picked up the phone and called me, most assuredly! I was then offered the option of writing a letter to "the board", or whomever, in an effort to plead my case... YEAH RIGHT!! "Better than a bank" my butt!  I have two other financial institutions that I bank with, and I've never had an issue like this, even after a "period of inactivity". Those banks that TFCU claims to be better than, have treated me much better, and have actually treated me like a person - not just an account. Please! Please! PLEASE! Save yourself the headache, and RUN (don't walk) from this CU. They will try to rob you of your money!”
- “It's never welcoming or inviting each time i come. The people that work here look upset and not happy. It's alway awkward and not a Pleasant experience. It makes me want to refinance my car and go to a new bank. Really it doesn't even deserve that one star i gave.”
- “I joined this credit union in the belief that they generally have better customer service and lower fees than big banks, but they have consistently disappointed in both areas.  I opened the account with a large deposit but my funds were immediately frozen -- for three weeks! I don't need much from a bank but it seemed like even simple transactions were a problem. Their mobile banking works pretty well but their ATMs are out of service more often than not.  When I got a $160 check from the Canadian Government you would have thought I was trying to pass a check from Upper Moldovakia.  I had to go through the usual long line the bank, and after a lot of scrutiny, they decided maybe they would allow me to delosit the check in my account for a $20 fee (on top of the normal exchange rate).  I wrote two letters to Customer Service, but by the time I finally got a response (three weeks later), I had switched to a bank that charges a much lower fee for foreign transactions.”

- “I am a single mom and was looking to just have a few heavy items moved, having never used movers before I didn't know the in and outs ... cost etc. That said I called and the man that answered the phone was rude and basically laughed when I told him the budget I had. He told me the fees start from the moment they get in the truck and when I explained how small the job is he snickered and said it didn't matter. No work with, negotiations NOTHING I guess being working class and on a tight budget is laughable to this company ... obviously I won't use them I hope you don't either ... I will say that karma has a way of leveling the playing field hope it finds its way to this business”
- “Worst moving company I have ever hired, they claim that we had bed bugs, but in fact we had the pest control come out to check we had no bed bugs, the guy who came out walk in the house for 5 seconds and left said were infested. I explained to him that we had a expert check and were clean, when did this guy become a professional pest inspector? So he left and said "you have bed bugs I'll give you a number to another company who move you in today" NO not cool when we didn't have any. I'll also be doing a complain on BBB about this company, land the guy who came out to move us, his wife is a manager of the apartment complex were at, and yes this apartment complex is known for bed bugs but not everyone has it. So customer service 1 out of five stars.”
- “Just called for an estimated on moving a couple of pieces of furniture - an hour job may be, and first question man who answered phone asked is what is your budget. When I guessed what I thought an hour of manual labor would cost his reply sarcastically was " what do you think, we live in Mexico". Then he asked when I would like job done (I had already told I was looking to move these few pieces sometime over weekend). He quoted me $500 - obviously do not need business bad enough to simply be polite. I'd say "move on" to next listing dont bother with this Amazon”

- “Enhance Openings...all I have to say is WOW. Working with this company has been nothing short of a complete pleasure. We were blown away by our experience. Right out of the gate and throughout the entire process, this business delivered when it came to the foundational pillars of exceptional customer care and service. The owner, Jeff, is fantastic, and every employee we interacted with was equally as wonderful. It was great getting to know Brian and Zach, who spent two weeks at our home installing 34 new Pella windows. Daniel came at the end of the project to lead the installation of our new, rather massive front door and everything could not possibly have gone more smoothly. If you are looking for top notch professionalism and craftsmanship, Enhance Openings is undoubtedly the team for the job. Pick up the phone, give them a call - you won't be disappointed.”
- “I just purchased a new front door to replace my sagging, rotted, and sun-damaged wood door.  I opted for the fiberglass door made by Enhance Openings.  You pay a little extra but it's well worth it for a peace of mind.  Get it done right, once.  Eddie Flores was my contact person.  He came and showed me samples of door frames, locks, and hinges.  I opted for a fiberglass door with wood design and multi point lock system so the door still looks like a solid wood door.  The multi point lock makes it secure minus the steel/metal bar look.”
- “Highly recommended! A close family member recently made a purchase and we are super happy with the quality of the windows, expert installation and the service we were given from start to finish. You can tell the employees are well educated on what they offer and try their best to match your needs along side your investment!”

- “These folks have resorted to violating federal law by spam/robo calling. I would never give these people my business, based on this alone. Think of a better way to market yourselves.”
- “I can't recommend this place.  I talked to a guy that knocked on my door from Enhance. I then spoke with a lady on the phone about setting up an appointment. While on the phone, I was mislead (I believe intentionally) to believe that this company had patio door screens (not patio enclosures, but screens for the sliders).  Fast forward to the sit down appointment. A guy came to our home, took measurements, and had us pick out some design options. The options were great. The product seemed solid. However, this company did not carry the screens that I was interested in for my patio sliders. They only had patio enclosures. Despite feeling mislead, I tried to be open to the idea of an enclosure, until I saw the price. Yeah.........no.  As soon as the salesman realized my hesitance from seeing the price, he worked with different products and financing options. However, nothing seemed right. When the mention of other companies was brought up, the salesman became a bit defensive. He asked me if I was okay with trusting my family's safety to sub-par security. He also kept repeating how only this company was awarded some international security title. I do not recall the exact title, but I haven't been able to locate anything on their website about this title nor could I find anything about its existence.  Lastly, the sales pitch was very stressful and very pushy. Like other reviews have said, the salesman stated they can give me a better rate if I lock in the sale on the spot. However, if I wait the rate will change. When the meeting was finally over, I started receiving texts from the company almost daily (4 out of 5 days before I declined to go any further with this company). The texts started becoming less friendly by the day.  Honestly, I can't say I would recommend this place. I felt mislead, insulted, and hassled by this company.”
- “Avoid this company. Too painful to go into. just remember you can cancel 3 days after signing their contract. Why not reveal your prices instead of making you decide after the presentation to get the best price. I cant believe I fell for this.”

- “This has been the best delivery service we have  received in 13 years!  The driver contacted us about 45 minutes prior to arrival and provided us with enough time to prepare for the delivery.  When Malek and Ramira arrived, they were courteous and professional.  They removed the old oven, and installed the new one with no issues.  We asked them to wear booties, which they did gladly.  Malek gave us an excellent overview of our new stove's functions, and ensured that all the paperwork was in order.  We would definitely use this company again.”
- “I had a great experience with Barlow's delivery.  They delivered my new oven from Home Depot.  Carlos is especially friendly and customer service oriented.  Corey his assistant was also very polite and helpful.  They gave me time to clean behind my old oven after they removed it.  They set my clock and showed me how to operate the control panel features and tested the timer.  They let me test each of the oven's features to make sure they worked including testing all 4 burners on "HIGH" and even boil a small sauce pan of water to test how long it took to boil water.  Carlos even saved me money.  He informed me that the 3-pring plug was already included on my unit so that I would get a refund for the one I ordered from Home Depot at $25 and he noted that on my paperwork and returned the unused plug to the warehouse.  I received a call 2 days before my delivery date, a lady informed me that I would be getting a call from my delivery guy on delivery day and that they would be coming between a 4-hour window of 8am-12pm.  I also made extra sure they had my home address so they wouldn't accidentally deliver to my billing address.  MAKE SURE TO DO THAT.    The day of delivery Carlos called and I was away from my phone but he left a message letting me know they were on their way.  They showed up about 20 minutes later.  I had already made sure I had made a clear path from their truck to my kitchen and secured my pet in the room to make delivery easy and had cleaning supplies handy to clean quickly behind the old oven (broom, towel and 409).  The entire process took about 30 minutes from the time they arrived to the time they left.  I was so pleased I called Barlow's to compliment them to their boss.  Just remember: our attitude directly affects a delivery person's attitude.  I greeted Carlos with a big smile and he returned it in kind!  And it was raining (rain storm day after Thanksgiving!) so their job was a little harder than usual, especially since my old school 1980s oven they removed was super heavy.  Love my new oven and it arrived in perfect condition.  NOTE: MAKE SURE THEY HAVE YOUR DELIVERY ADDRESS if you have a different billing address to ensure they deliver to your home address.  I am glad I did that because I read in one of the reviews that they delivered to their billing address.”
- “Barlow delivery brought my refrigerator and detected a leak in the refrigerator box that supplies water.  I had to get a plumber out here that day, and they rescheduled and squeezed me in the next day!  The two men who brought it out were polite and respectful.  They pulled out a huge old refrigerator that needed the doors removed they did it quickly.  The got that old refrigerator out through some tricky corners without touching a thing.  They set up the new one, hooked up the water, and leveled it.  Great job!  I would recommend them to anyone.”

- “Worst experience ever.  The Home Depot should be ashamed that they use this delivery service.  They didn't show up for the scheduled delivery date and never bothered to call and let me know.  Nothing like waiting all day in a Saturday for a scheduled delivery and having nobody show up.  They took it upon themselves to reschedule on a day they saw fit without even calling me.  I then rescheduled for a day that I took from off from work.  They were supposed to call ahead when delivering, no call.  Didn't matter because I was home waiting for them anyways.  They never showed up.   I called Barlow and spoke with Vanessa, she was so rude and basically told me I was lying and wasn't home for the delivery.  I then spoke with "the supervisor" "Dee" she had a worse attitude than Vanessa.  She told me I was not home for the delivery and I was out of luck and could reschedule 2 weeks from that day.  Really?  How rude, I  took the day off from work to receive my delivery, of course I was home.  Do not buy appliances from any company who uses this delivery service.  Just read all of the similar reviews.  They are an emabarassment to The Home Depot.”
- “Stay away!!!! My experience is like the rest of the negative reviews. Called me an hour before delivery raced home in the middle of the day from work To find a note on the door that I had missed my delivery. I was within the time frame. Called to talk with the dispatcher and was told that I had missed the delivery by 4 mins. Asked to turn the truck around and the dispatcher stated that they were out of my area! Asked how far can they get in 4 minutes then she became rude. NO CUSTOMER SKILLS OF ANY SORT BY BARLOWS DISPATCHER. If I would've known that Home Depot was going to use a 1 star delivery company I would not have made the purchase. I Ended up canceling my order with Home Depot”
- “Had a brand new washer and dryer delivered.  The guy in the truck stacks them on top of each other and they fall about 12 feet from the lift and crash on to the cement driveway. I could tell the guy was worried that I saw it.  Which I did and had to refuse delivery as the items were then damaged.  Now I have to wait who knows how many more weeks for them to ship new ones.”

## Tips from customers
Don't throw away money The worst! 4 delivery guys, all looking like they just get out of prison showed up an hr an a half later than the 3 hr block they scheduled. Wow, then made up a story about a dog that kept changing breeds on them.. so wild. As I was just trying to help out a friend I was definitely not going to let these unprofessional, disrespectful liars onto a friend's property. Any company that refuses to let you document how they treat your property, be ware. No thanks, I actually like to keep my belongs.

- “As a Realtor with 10 years of experience, I know a good agent when I meet one. I first met Ginny through our mutual participation on the Property Management Committee at the Tucson Association of Realtors, as well as the Small Broker Network. She immediately impressed me with her knowledge of laws and rules regarding real estate and property management. At the time, several large property management companies were being shut down for embezzling large sums of money from their clients. Ginny was one of the first to volunteer ideas and her time to create ways to protect the public from this type of harm. I could see her passion for the industry and for promoting and protecting her clients' best interest.  When I needed to refer my clients to a new property manager, Ginny was the first and only person I called. I knew that my clients' properties and finances would be safe under Imagine Realty's care.  I would not hesitate to recommend Imagine Realty to all my friends and family for their property management needs.”
- “They've been our property manager for over 7 years! We've been very satisfied with their service. They always communicate well with us and do their best to find high quality tenants.”

- “I tried to schedule a tour with her, and not only was she late without letting me know, but she was incredibly rude about it. Being late is fairly unprofessional in my eyes, but being curt and snappy about it is really unpleasant.  But when she finally arrived at the property, I found that she never alerted the tenants about our arrival. So there was me and about four other people with their families interested in touring the house and the tenant had no idea. When addressed about the miscommunication, she was incredibly rude and short with the tenant. There was a lot of back and forth about who was the source of the miscommunication, and Ginny stubbornly insisted that her secretary told them about the tours today and that they forgot. He kindly offered to get the house and his family ready in twenty minutes, but Ginny refused and said that it would make her late for her other appointments.   I lost all interest in the property. Never stepped foot in it. Rude and bad management turns me off completely.”
- “Don't use them to rent out your property!  Sadly, we have had them for a number of years.  Just as we get ready to fire them (when our contract with a tenant comes up for renewal), they go out and find us a new tenant, locking us into another year-long agreement with them.  They make repairs to our home without our prior approval (we just want a heads-up when our rent check will be less because of a repair), they refuse to let us go into our own home to make a minor repair (like fix a screw in a door), and they always have "computer issues and will have to call back" when we call and want a response to an issue.  And like another reviewer said, they seem to make their own rules as they go along.  During the last tenant move-out, the carpet cleaner mentioned a stain on the carpet that he couldn't get out.  I asked Imagine Realty if they charged the tenant for that (the carpet was brand new and only one week old when the tenant moved in) and when we'd see that money.  Imagine Realty tried to tell me the carpet wasn't new and that it was an existing stain--even knowing they have the carpet warranty (showing install date) in our file at their office!  Then she said they did a walk thru and didn't see a stain.  But they won't let me in my own house to see for myself!!!   I could write a book with the problems we've had with this company.  Everything about their operation is shady.  Don't make the same mistake we did!”
- “This is one of those times where I really wish I had listened to the other one star reviews and saved myself the emotional pain of dealing with this company.  This company asked me for money before they would create a lease. Naturally, I asked to see a copy of the lease before giving them money. They sent me a "sample" lease. I went forward assuming the only change between the "sample" and the actual lease would be names and addresses. After I gave them a large sum of money they sent me the actual lease, and I found that the sample lease was missing an ENTIRE 14 PAGES. The 14 additional pages increased my responsibility for maintenance to a point I was not comfortable with, and was strict enough that I felt it would seriously limit my ability to enjoy the property. When I tried to bring these issues up and other concerns I had about the lease, they refused to talk (too busy and only had time for email), pointed out that I wouldn't get my money back, and tried to blame me for backing out when I already "had a sample lease." Long story short, they did decide to refund my money, but I really wish they had been clear from the start so I could have avoided going through all of this.  To tenants considering working with the company, I seriously recommend asking for the lease, insist on the actual lease, before you give them money. To the landlord, I really really loved your beautiful property, but I can't work with this company.”

Save your receipt and do the online survey to get a free Big Mac or Quarter Pounder. Depends on what your receipt says... McRib is back! This Location is a Total Pathetic  Failure !!  I asked the Manager on duty why it took 20 minutes for a # 11 and a # 2.  The Place is FUBAR So slow! They have 2 lanes but no idea how run them! How do they forget a 20 piece chicken nugget?  Another screwed up order Open 24 hours. Both drive thru & dine in area! Always screw up order, get it together The worst service  tonight  22 minutes in drive thru to get my food cold and sitting Gotta try the bacon clubhouse burger Just plan rude. Needs some help. Playland! Service horrid, food worse Terrible Service. Same times take to long to give you the food on the drive true No toilet paper or hand towels. Had to wipe with underwear then go commando.

- “The lady gouged my husbands toe.  Dug into it so hard it was bleeding and somehow also cut the side of his toe.  Then he said she put what appeared to be glue on it to stop the bleeding.  Can't even clean the dried blood because of the glue or whatever the crap was she put on it.  It looks terrible!!  I'm praying he doesn't get an infection.  His toe is sore as heck.”
- “I simply can't go back. I  gave it a second shot. For the price I paid I expected good service.  Non-engaging. Treated as if I  was a pain rather than a customer.  I  asked repeatedly for her not to touch a certain area with my pedicure which she promptly and continually ignored.  Her phone, fellow employee and tv were more interesting.  The fact that all speech basically was in their native tongue,  I  really felt like I wasn't wanted there. I will not return.  BTW, their sign outside says 10% off. There's no discount.  Paying almost  $40.00 for a regular pedicure that should include what they charge extra for is ridiculous.  I won't be back and would highly suggest that you don't waste your time and money for a barely mediocre job.”
- “I've been here a couple times and the only reason I keep going is because it's close to my home. The owner she's very nice. What I don't really like is the wait. I also avoid getting a pedicure with the owners husband because he does it in a rush. I stopped going because I got foot fungus from my last pedicure, now I need to remove my entire nail and take steroids for the foot fungus. They price are high, as if you pay with a credit card is a $1.00 more m, and even if you tell them you don't want gel, they still do it. I won't be back anymore.”

- “Firstly, as we had finished paying for the room and were walking out of the office, the front desk clerk stated very emphatically that we are not allowed to smoke in the room - even though we had asked for a non-smoking room. That was the first sign that he thought we were scum, and was not afraid to show it. Secondly, he accused us of having discussed illegal activities while parking on the street - a complete fabrication, which, besides, would have been none of his business had it been true, since the street is not part of Econo Lodge's premises. Thirdly, he called our room just to warn us that no visitors are allowed - the third sign that he thought us total scum. Lastly, I asked for an invoice of my hotel stay, and all he could provide was a duplicate receipt of my credit card payment. When I asked if this document was sufficient to claim my Choice Rewards points, he said yes. This was not the case, and I had to call him to get the confirmation number for my stay. I asked him on the phone why he did not provide it when I was there, and he accused me of not having asked for it - again, a complete fabrication. No apologies were issued for the bad service. If you enjoy being treated like you belong in prison for life, then you ought to stay the night at this motel.”
- “I picked this hotel because it was close to the Hospital where my brother is being treated. Unfortunately once I checked into my room I discovered stained linens full of hair. It was a disgusting sight to realize that not much care is taken into maintaining a clean and hygienic hotel room. I asked the clerk for my money back but I was declined. It was late and I needed rest, at  this point I just wanted out of this hotel and left to check into the Holiday Inn in Marana, AZ. I did not use the room and I feel I should receive a full refund for the money paid upfront for 1 night stay. I don't usually leave comments/complaints but I feel this situation warranted.  I look forward to hearing from the hotel manager/.”
- “Long story short I was pretty sure I was going to die the entire time. Police were called when an assault happened in the room next to ours. I was so dumb for booking this place. Never staying in an econo lodge again.  Oh and on top of the police being called and the drunk homeless man screaming, the place was filthy and smelt of smoke.  I would give 0 stars if I could.”

- “This complex is horrible. The community of people who are living there are terrible people and the staff do not care whatsoever about anyone living there; only about the money that they are making. There were people doing drugs, not just weed, but actual drugs like heroin, out in the open and not even trying to hide it. There are so many drunks and sketchy ass people there. My appt. always smelled like cigarettes because my neighbors smoked inside and this was overall just a terrible decision. I am so glad I left there. I had such a horrible experience that I actually left after two months of being there. Don't do it!”

- “I also bought a groupon. I called three times over 6 months with no response. After threatening to report the company for fraud, they called me back. Then I think to be funny, the office girl called me back three times in 10 minutes to schedule an appointment. When the two workmen showed up, they both immediately asked to use my restroom. One of them left a huge dump and stopped up the toilet which I had to fix. One gentleman was a hard worker with their beat-up equipment. Meanwhile, the other man made himself right at home at my kitchen table and later on my couch. He was completely unprofessional and I couldn't wait for them to leave. I would not recommend this company to anyone.”
- “I didn't have any trouble scheduling my appointment, but had to wait three weeks for the first available.  That was supposed to be today. They just didn't show up. No phone call. Do I really have to give them a star to post this?”
- “this company is a rip off and completely unethical in their business practices (they try to sell you something you either don't need or that they say needs to be replaced but doesn't).  they can vacuum out your ductwork okay, but that is it.  don't believe any of the other hype.”

## Tips from customers
Look for the free coupon that's mailed in the value pack. Don't go shopping on Groupon when it's free. Also, make sure you explain to them that you want the basic cleaning and free additional service and that is it. Tell them you don't want a technician that will try to sell you a lot more.

- “I work with the Town of Sahuarita in helping with the organization of events.  Some of these events bring in anywhere from 1000 people to 15000 people. While putting on our biggest event of the year "Fiesta Sahuarita" Republic Services did an outstanding job in providing our event with a display vehicle and approximately 80 large totes; both recycling and general trash.  The employees were hard working and would interact with anyone who had questions.  Republic services made our event a smooth one and definitely made our process a lot smoother. Thank you Republic Services!”
- “So this company has been absolutely amazing with us. We are a non profit organization and they have helped us out not once but twice. We had a 4 ya dumpster to begin with and it was the perfect size (4yd) and pick up schedule (once every 2 weeks). Our non profit got bigger we needed pick up once a week and it was like a miracle they just agreed to do it for the same price. I was just shocked and very grateful.  We kept growing and we needed pick up twice a week......that too they agreed upon. Not many companies out there even bother to acknowledge us. These wonderful people at Republic are just angels. We are ever so grateful and thankful to them. I can't say enough good things about them except to forever be grateful to them.”
- “We are very pleased with Republic Services.  They have been reliable and  timely over many years of service.  Also they give back to the community through their many charitable causes and events.   We have used their service for many years and do not have one complaint.  I was really astounded to see some poor reviews since they service most of the communities in my area of Arizona and people seem very pleased with them.”

- “I highly recommend NOT using this company.  They have not picked up my recycling 7 times in the last 2 months.  When I first started service last year, they charged me in advance but did not pick up my garbage or recycling.  I file a "missed pickup" ticket via the app, but nobody every responds.”
- “They missed picking up our garbage.  I called them and they told me they would pick it up the next day.  I left the garbage out and once again it was not picked up.  Contacted customer service again, waited on hold for over 30 minutes only to have the customer service rep disconnect the call.  Done with this company.  Complete incompetence.  You've been warned.”
- “Very dissatisfied .   Have had no trash pick up since Thanksgiving..  they have picked up recycle bin on schedule.   Theircustomer service/  experience rating is negative.   One rep told me they cannot make a pick up and I could take it a landfill myself last Thursday.  They scheduled a pick up for yesterday again a no show.  Today my scheduled day recycle picked up but no trash.  Called at 4PM.  And said tomorrow.   I am sure that I will be one the phone tomorrow.  There is thanksgiving garbage in the container .”

- “Last week I received a birthday themed bouquet of flowers that were stunning! The flowers were exceptionally fresh and beautifully arranged. They lasted a whole week. I was very impressed and would order from them myself. I wonder if this place is under new management as my experience was completely different than some of the other reviews earlier this year.”

- “Ordered flowers online from them to commemorate an anniversary.  The only thing about the arrangement that was the same as what was described/pictured online was that the flowers were roses and in the right vase.  Everything else from how they were arranged to the color to the contents were wrong. As we had marked the "No Substitutions" choice, I was rather frustrated.   No one answered the phone when I called. When finally arriving at the location, I was told that all florists make substitutions and that it was pretty much the same thing.”
- “I'd give this company a zero rating if I could. From all the 1 star reviews on here I guess I should have checked Yelp before ordering.   I had ordered a sympathy basket for my grandmother's funeral.  I picked out a basket with a wildflower look to it & opted for the deluxe upgrade so the total cost was a bit over $119.  The ordered basket was to have purple and white roses, bells of Ireland, heather, aster 'monte cassino',  trachelium and fresh greenery arranged in a willow basket.  The day of the funeral we walked into the chapel and I was very upset & disappointed that our flowers were not there!  Upon closer inspection, there was an arrangement of flowers with our message attached (misspelled, btw), but it looked absolutely NOTHING like what we had ordered.  This arrangement had pink snapdragons, pink lilies, green gladiolus and alstroemeria. The only thing correct was that it was in a basket!    In addition to these being the wrong flowers, I recognized it as a different arrangement offered on the website.  I looked it up and low-&-behold, this arrangement (deluxe option) was only $55.  I had been charged $100+ for the flowers I wanted & had gotten a much cheaper arrangement of flowers to boot.   I contacted "From You Flowers" and talked to one of their representatives. After explaining the issue to him, he checked my order and absolutely agreed it was the completely wrong arrangement.  He apologized profusely and informed me that I would be getting a FULL refund.   Upon checking the email receipt they sent me, I was only refunded $51.89! Fast-forward to today. I again called "From You Flowers" and spoke to a different representative.  I again explained the situation and told her that I had only been refunded the amount of the flowers I got, not those I had paid for (I didn't realize immediately that the flowers delivered were more than that at $55+).  The rep checked the order and informed me that I had been refunded the 50% that was their policy.  I informed her that the person I had spoken to the first time had told me I would be getting a FULL refund. She countered that no, 50% is their policy and that's that.  So basically I ordered a $100+ arrangement, they delivered a $55 arrangement, and then they get to pocket the other $67 and screw you.  Very nice business plan. Hope they go under.  It goes without saying I will never order from here again.”
- “This should not be called a business.  It is not worthy of being called anything but a waste of hard earned money.  I received flowers at 3:00pm today 24 hours late that are ready to be discarded.  The delivery person left a message yesterday as she could not find the address.  Then told me she was done for the day and it would arrive today.  It arrived at 3:00pm today (10/19) a day after my birthday and the flowers were droopy and falling off the stems.  They were ordered by dear friends in Missouri in good faith and should not be paid for.  When I looked up this Shop I found 12 previous 1 star reviews so my experience was not a one time error but the manner in which they handle orders. A true shame.....takes the joy out of receiving flowers.  PLEASE DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM.  Your loved ones will be very disappointed by the gift you lovingly tried to send.”

- “The solar panels don't work and their customer service doesn't do anything. I have called them numerous times. My electric bill has more than doubled and I'm still paying rent on these solar panels. DON'T do business with Sunrun.”
- “Stay away from Sunrun. Horrible experience since we got the system. First year the inverter went out. Took Sunrun 3 months to fix. Now the same issue going on our third month without system working, and it's only 3 yrs with Sunrun! Please do your search and stay away from SUNRUN!!!!”
- “It should be spelled SunRUIN and only deserve 0 stars. I pay $183 a month to SunRuin for no power generation; but I'm paying $250/month to TEP since SunRuin has not generated power since July (it's now mid-September).  I was told that my system failed and I would, "receive a call from a technician within 5 business days."  NEVER received a call - even after placing 3 calls to SunRuin and their technicians.  21 days later, a technician arrived and replaced the inverter.  Still no power.  Another "5 days..." empty promise issued and STILL never received a call.  All communication between us has been initiated by the customer. Not one call initiated or returned from SunRuin. Oh yes - their "generation promise."  At the end of the year they promise (sic) to reimburse me if they do not reach the contracted production that I paid for.  Any excess generation that I banked for cloudy days pays them first so they do not have to reimburse me for my TEP bills.  Too bad I trusted them.   DO NOT waste your money  with this company!”

## Tips from customers
I love REC Solar, you won't find a solar company with a better reputation. They know solar, and they are partners with Costco!

When I have issues (only twice ever and very small issues) I call the front and they have someone come and fix it the next morning. Overall it's great for the price I'm paying.”

- “horrible staff communication. extremely rude. They seem to forget who they are working for. Beside from the most horrible management possible, water gets shut off more than once a week. I don't understand how they can be constantly working on the water. When it it working it is either constantly ice cold, or Luke warm.  When it rains my bedroom floor would flood. They don't seem to care.  Upstairs neighbor dogs urine and waste goes on my balcony and low and behold management could not care less. Left me with "we can't get ahold of your neighbor." Okay? Walk to their apartment knock and tell them it's disgusting. I can't believe I ever lived here for the price you pay. On top of every little utility you pay out of pocket. (Gas? My apartment doesn't even use gas? Sewage? Since when do you pay sewage? Garbage, etc.) oh and can't forget about paying for water that doesn't work. Ever.  Better off living in a tent. Or in your car.”
- “I will preface this by saying great area and unit. Also I am not a whiner, but if I am paying for a home, it should be a good home. Everything that I am saying here can be proven and is not liable. That being said, the management is awful. I lived (As of March 2015) in a downstairs unit. The above neighbor allowed their terrier to bark nonstop day and night and when the dog was bellowing with its shrill bark, it would jump up and land with a thud on the faux hardwood floors they had. It says right there in your lease that dogs are not to infringe on the quiet enjoyment of the neighbors. I am disabled and I have a condition that makes me home bound a lot. If I were working it probably wouldn't have been a big deal but I am not and they knew right off the bat that I was disabled.  I complained over 6 times before I had to sue them. I sued them because they put a document entitled "Intent to Terminate Lease" on my door instead of the person's door upstairs. Not only was I utterly confused and panicked from the document (with my name and unit number on it), I was given the document after it blew off my door by a neighbor. I was so embarrassed and hurt.  I told them the document was BS and that they were retaliating against me for "disturbing" a favored renter.  They claimed it was on accident, but the notice to the right party wasn't even posted for several days. What happen to all the other times I complained. Every other apartment I have rented, three strikes for noise and you are out.  Even before I sued them I asked to be moved or to be let out of my lease. They demanded two months worth of rent to terminate the lease and told me that they would not move me. They also told me that I had to tell them after they posted a notice that the neighbor was continuing to make noise. They offered, only after the court date came, to move me to another unit at my expense and there was no guarantee that they would renew my lease or not try to raise the rent.  Flash forward to today. They offered me a lease renewal and then when I came back to sign it they rescinded it. The neighbor got a lease renewal though. Come to find out the neighbor even offered to move to another unit but this company clearly preferred her to me. I don't want to make this about race, but I did notice that all the ethnic people in my building are dealt with swiftly and the neighbor after receiving numerous complaints (12 total), letters from animal control (which I forwarded to the office), and a cease and desist from the office is still in her unit.  My new apartment sent over a rental history verification form and guess what: Nothing owed (I was never late), no noise complaints, nothing destroyed, and etc.... I was a great tenant except I did not want to be hounded by dogs barking shrilly and jumping up and down on my ceiling at sometimes 3 AM.  I did win my Animal Control Hearing case against the neighbor though.   I recommend that if you are disabled or a minority, you be very weary of Scottia Group Management. Also do not rent H10 if you want peace and quiet!!! My suit is ongoing.”
- “Horrible horrible horrible! Office avoids residents. Since I've moved in none of my go backs have been done , I get the run around only temps in the office no permanent people to take me serious!”

- “Don't waste your time, been going here off and on for quite a while and never anything better than an okay experience. I attempted to get a bean and cheese burro and two shredded beef tacos which should be pretty simple... Tacos looked great but where filled with potatoes, burrito is salted down to the point you couldn't taste anything else. I'm realistic in food after a certain point in the evening but this is bad joke of an attempt. Again don't waste your time, I'll only be going back to give them their food back and to get my money back.”
- “Don't eat here. They may have good food, but their sanitary practices aren't. My husband ate there 2x getting sick both times. The time I ate there I also got sick. I work at the hospital north of here. After being diagnosed w H priori. A bacteria that lives in your stomach,and treated for it. I found that many other co- workers who have eaten there also got sick. BTW- h priori comes from people working with food & didn't wash their hands after going to the bathroom, or didn't correctly wash the food they use. Eewww. Plus its very painful. This place is so not worth 4 weeks on antibiotic meds.”

## Tips from customers
Four words:
Dreadful on every level. Change in size, quality and price = disapointment. This place is SUPER spacious, and really neat/clean. I think it's a new building so it's still fresh. The food is good and didn't take too long Love their potato tacos! Good food for reasonable price! One of the worst breakfast chorizo burritos ever Ewww just ewwwww...save your time and money Their Carne Asada is more like ground beef ...bleht :( This place has the best Machaca burritos! Terrible 24 hours! Open 24 hours! Rude nasty people Machaca con huevos was on point

Every time, supposedly the medicine is ready yet I'm there for a half hour of more waiting since it's either not ready or wrong. Today was the last draw, they did not fill my medicines as the doctor ordered. Totally off! I'm sick and tired, going to switch!!!”
- “This CVS has very poor leadership. They never have any of their shelves stocked. No matter what day of the week or time of day I come, I can never find what I need. Try another branch.”
- “Went in to drop off a return to Mazon package at the ups drop off inside the store at the front counter using a scan code given to me by Amazon. There was nobody at the front checkout counter/ups drop off counter. After about 5 minute a girl finally showed up. I told her i wanted to drop off a return to Amazon and showed her the scan code on my phone. She said she could not do that. She said i needed to have my own printed lBel on the packGe. I told her that the scan code is all that zmazon gzve me. I gold her that i had dropped off a similar pCkGe last wedk Nd the youbg m a n that was at the front counter had said fine. He scznned the code sith a phone znd gzve me a reciept and texted as ups usually does.  So i asked why they did last week what she claimed she could not do this week. My knly conclusion from this experience is that she is too stupid to do her job. And to wait 5 minutes for a clerk to show up at the check out counter only zggravated the situtation. I will never set foot in that cvs agin.”

- “This place is always a zoo! 7pm on a Thursday and the line is out the door; should have known better. I ordered online because my kids are on spring break and they have friends over. I'll order online and just play on my phone until it's ready. I'm glad they brought back the pretzel crust pizza. It's one of my favorites (don't judge) fresh our of the oven is great. Yes there is better pizza out there and I don't mind paying for it but for a $5 pepperoni that my kids wont pick the toppings off is worth it tonight.”

## 1★ samples (Negative Reviews)
- “Absolutely the worst service ever. Waited in line for 20 minutes just to order a hot-and-ready pepperoni and some crazy bread.  They were out of the pizza, I was told it would be 10-15 minutes until the pizza was ready.  At that time, they had plenty of crazy bread, so I anticipated no problem. But in the next 15 minutes the counter person sold all the crazy bread to the people behind me in line, so when my pizza was done 15 minutes later, I was told it would now be another 15-20 minutes before I would get the crazy bread.  By the time I got my pizza and crazy bread I had been in the store for almost an hour, so much for hot-and-ready.  But what really burned me was I got no real explanation why it took so long, the counter person offered nothing for making me wait a half hour, not a glass of water, a drink, nothing.  Oh, and I forgot to say that it was very warm in the store, everyone was dripping sweat as they waited. While the pizza and crazy bread was pretty good, I doubt that I'll ever be going back to that location.”
- “OMG, this is the worst little Caesars ever.  It's 10/1/2018.   There are 25 people standing around waiting to be helped.   Hot and Ready.  Whatever.   The girl at the register is too busy complaining to really help anyone.  The so called manager is sliding herself around the building with no purpose at all.     I get it this place is in the hood and 99.9% of the folks served here are brown people but dang.  We like and deserve good service too.     There is not one employee in this place that seems to care one bit about hw horrible this experience is.  Everyone in this place should be terminated right now.    Most of us have been waiting 15-25 mins.    Clearly many of these folks are use to this.   This is truly awful.”
- “Where do I even start? I guess I can begin with the fact that I would give this place zero stars if possible.   I would also like to preface this by saying I have had a family member work for Little Caesar's as an Assistant Manager and when I brought the pizzas home and told him about the service we experienced, he was absolutely repulsed (to say the least).  We placed our order at 1921 (7:21 P.M.) and did not receive our order until almost an hour later.  The Pizza Portal was inactive and empty at the time of arrival. Customers were forced to go up to the counter and give their name to receive their order. We decided to be courteous and stand in line.   They did not follow the Hot-N-Ready promise to any extent. It took almost an hour to receive our food. The store walls were lined with people waiting to order and it was trailed out the door. The Hot Boxes were full, yet customer service was inadequate (we were ignored when we finally arrived at the counter and someone was taken care of before us even though we were next in line at the counter).   We ordered four ExtraMostBestest pizzas with stuffed crust and we received two ExtraMostBestest pizzas with stuffed crust but with little to no cheese in the crust and both pizzas were undercooked. Our other two pizzas we received were classic pepperoni pizzas in ExtraMostBestest pizza boxes. The two classic pepperoni pizzas were over-cooked and clear not what we ordered. We also ordered two orders of Crazy Bread and both bags were undercooked, uncut, and not buttered.  The cleanliness of the store was questionable at best, with receipts and napkins strewn all over the floor.  While we waited at the counter, we watched one of the pizzas get pushed out of the warmer and land upside down on the floor. The cashier picked it up, checked that the pizza toppings were still intact, and then closed the box. Somehow we ended up with that pizza! (Refer to photo attached.)  I ordered and paid for six ranch cups online and was only given three. I asked for three more and was relieved that they didn't make me pay for them.  Absolutely horrendous service! I will definitely not be returning to this location and would recommend you spend your money and your time somewhere else.”

- “I ordered a few cichlids, panda and a golden nugget pleco.  I received the cichlids first and was curious why the others hadn't arrived.  I reached and received a response within a day or two they should ship in the next week or two.  Indeed they did, also alive.  I had no issues with this company and will buy from them again.”
- “I have read many reviews this being the second time I have ordered from AZGardens. I have never been disappointed from any aquarium pets I have ordered from them. My very first time I ordered from them was the Blue Dolphins Large Cichlids and they both came in good. This is my second time I have ordered now and this pertain to a more quiet tank. This order included 1- Hillstream  Loach, 1- Fire Eel, 1- Cobalt Blue Lobster, 1- PEarl White Freshwater Lobster, 1- Golden Longfin Bushy Nose Pleco, 1- Tire Track Eel, and have not had any problems with this company. So I give them 5 Stars!! The other two are most likely enjoying the habitat.”
- “I've been dealing with AZ Gardens for several years now, and have always been happy with the service I've gotten from Pete. Whenever there's a problem, Pete is always willing to work with me to solve it.  Next day air shipping is expensive and is really the only way you can get a DOA guarantee. Over the years I would say 90% comes through in great condition, while 10% have issues - very good, but not perfect. When dealing with shipping anything living, this is to be expected. It's important when ordering the fish to always include about a 10% buffer just in case you do get some DOA's as additional AIR shipping is usually too much to justify re-ordering small amounts of fish.  AZ gardens is not for everyone. You want a special rare fish they are an awesome source. Also if you have a substantially large order, they are great to get the items out.  However, for most enthusiasts who are ordering small amounts, I would recommend them going to their LFS or looking for resources locally as small orders shipping costs usually outweigh the cost of the fish.  Also, making sure to add the heat packs and signature required is a must. The AIR shipping gets cold, and as such, having the heat packs in there ensures the live arrival, also, letting the package sit out on your porch without proper heating/cooling is not good, so make sure you can get it indoors as soon as it arrives.”

- “When I moved from Chicago to rural Oregon, I found there were no LFS's within a two hour drive. So I pretty much had to buy fish and plants online when I set up my aquariums once again. I had heard of Arizona Gardens for many years, long before I would need to place an order for plants or fish online. They always seemed first class, with a very professional appearing website and in business for 33 years. They seemed like a safe bet. Stupidly, I didn't bother to check their reviews online.  Big mistake!  Like most of the other reviewers here, I discovered they refuse to communicate, ship slowly, send the wrong items, and things arrive dead. They are quick to process your credit card charge though!   I ordered six different kinds of plants. Three of those I received were not what I ordered, even though the bags said they were. (I've kept aquariums for 75 years; I do know the difference.) Two were bags full of mush. One was alive (barely), but nearly all the leaves had fallen off. One included fewer plants than I was charged for. All my attempts to contact them have been futile.  Somewhere on their website they say they treat their customers like family. Those must be some dysfunctional family get togethers!  Stay away. They talk a great game (as all con artists do), but they only care about getting your money, not what you receive in return. As others have said, they are nothing but scammers.”
- “I am an aquarium enthusiast.  I have a large tank with both beautiful fish and plants.  I was searching for a new plant that I believed would look and do well in my tank. This plant I was searching for ended up being a less common plant; which made it harder to find.  When I came across Arizona Aquatic Gardens with a match with what I was searching for, additionally the website's write up clinched my decision to place an order.  When I did receive my plants though, I could not have been more dissatisfied, and disappointed.  The plant (if you could call it that) arrived,  as a wilted, rotten mess.  I paid for premium shipping so purportedly my shipment would only be a few days.  It took two weeks.  Arizona Aquatic Gardens whole website is nothing more than a massive lie and a con. There really is no way to get ahold of them.  Their phone just rings with no messaging.  No one answers, and their complaint page is not responded to.  They claim they would respond expeditiously.  They do not respond at all.  I absolutely, abjectly, and resolutely am warning envy one who reads this to never, ever do business with Arizona Aquatics Gardens.  You will receive something in the manner of what you purchased.  However, what you receive will be most likely be dead, or dying.  Should you make the unfortunate mistake I made by buying something from them.  I highly recommend you put a complaint in with the Arizona Better Business Bureau.”
- “Update: All but one of the shrimp I ordered have died, and one of the five killifish I ordered have survived after treating them due to an outbreak of ich.  So basically I spent $101.00 for one red cherry (12 originally ordered) shrimp and one killifish (not including the malechite green for ich treatment).”

## Tips from customers
Order online! It saves time! Great services !!! Thanks Peter for your help and knowledge !! Be sure to read Yelp & BBB reviews regarding this company if you are considering placing an order Won't respond to emails about missing orders or least try to explain never again!

- “Came back to see if my negative review was still here after talking to another pool owner who complained about Jerimiah. It is NOT. Yelp says companies cannot remove negative reviews but apparently they can. Do not TRUST this guy with your money in advance. I did get a refund after complaining but I see many others have the same complaint and money was not returned. Yes he will 'bribe' you and ask you to take down your negative review for the return of your money.”
- “worst experience we've ever had with a service company. First time out did a good job so we hired them at a discounted rate--what a mistake! Came once when the door was locked and left immediately even though we had someone here to open the door. (their message says return call in 5 mins but not when they know they are being called back. made no effort to come until a week later. Still kept them on and when we came back from our vacation--pool was a disaster! Also heard from our guest house person that despite the monsoons, the "pool guy" came for less than 4 minutes the prior week. Immediately called a new service who found that the system hadn't been back-washed in weeks. I'm usually a pretty forgiving person, but this experience was just way too much for me to pass over”
- “2019-Gave us a discount if we paid a year in advance, we did.  He showed up at the beginning for a couple of months.  Then he stopped coming.  We would call and he always had excuses why he didn't come-my son graduated and many more.   I finally said, give us the remaining balance he owes.  He asked us to give him another chance.  I said no, and I wanted my money back.  He said ok, however, he never gave me my money back.  I am never going to see the money.”

The movers were conscientious and none of our property was damaged.  They would not even let us help move any of the items!!!!!!!!  I have only good things to say about our experience with All My Sons.”
- “I would definitely recommend All My Sons. I was very impressed at how quickly they moved me considering I was paying an hourly rate. I moved about 100 miles out of town and I was surprised at how quickly they showed up at the new door with all my stuff! They were not taking advantage of the time and they even helped me decided on how to arrange furniture in my new home. These guys did not stop until the job was done! I couldn't fault them!”
- “I would highly recommend this fed ex location. I called the call center which didn't not give accurate info.  However came to get my package physically and Anthony who was a member working at the time 6:52 pm was extremely polite and assisted right away!!”

## 1★ samples (Negative Reviews)
- “This is what I get for not reading the Yelp reviews first... Easily THEEEE WORST moving experience I've ever had. The movers themselves were okay. I'd recommend them. But the company itself has so many hidden extra charges that blew my budget away. I will not be using them again. Terrible experience.”
- “DO NOT hire All of My Sons!! We hired them 5 weeks in advance and they cancelled on us the day of our move! I called the day before and was told we were the second move btwn 12-4pm. On Saturday, our moving day, I receive a call at 11:30am that they are running behind and will be there at 4pm. At 3:30 pm Damian calls to cancel and reschedule in the morning between 7:30-9am... Are you kidding me?!?!? You screw up and overbook and then can't figure it out and be there at 8am, we need a 90 minute window? And then you have the gall to complain that you have to come in on your day off, seriously?! TBNT. Glad I got my money back and went with EZ Move who not only came to our rescue first thing Sunday morning - even arrived 10 mins early- they did a fantastic job! Save your time and frustrations, go with EZ move!”
- “They gave me an estimate of $500-600 for a move from Tucson to Phoenix and I put down a $100 deposit. Then they refused to unload my furniture until I paid them the remaining $1,052.60 for a $1,152.60 bill.  They went on and on about a two hour minimum load and unload time and then about fuel surcharges that were never part of the original estimate.  When I called for them to send me the receipt, which was a screenshot from their computer, the "estimate" was $20,000. I shudder to think of what might have happened if they had demanded $20,000 from me.  NEVER NEVER put down a deposit or hire ANYONE without getting a written quote in advance that includes their policies for binding vs. non-binding agreements, payment policies, etc.  This was a short-notice move for a new job and I let my guard down and paid the price.  Never again.”

## Tips from customers
Check your itemized receipt. They charge $46 for packing tape. If you discuss with movers to call it will get taken off. That's pitiful. I wish I would have read reviews first. You are supposed to be able to relax when someone else does the work. This was not relaxing. Terrible, do not recommend. They gave us a quote and pricing rate of $89 an hour which is not bad. We have everything packed and ready to be moved ten minutes down the road expecting a 45 minutes to an hour move. After setting up the move and paying a non-refundable deposit of $50, we got the conformation call the night before and they then informed us it would be a minimum 2 hr charge and that we would be paying for gas and the minimum payment of $293. This was outrageous. We complained and all we heard back from the person who assisted us is the man who help us was named john and he "should" have told us but he did not and there was nothing she could do or refund. Not even an apology. I have worked in 5 star 4 diamond service industry for a long time and this would never fly. There service before and after is a joke and recommend anywhere else other than this CON. Even considering legal action This was outrageous.

- “I would HIGHLY recommend this company.  They serviced my 15 year old system that covers a large amount of area (nearly and acre), fixing leaks,  moving and adding emitters and generally brought the system back to life.  Plants that had been struggling for years have taken off, citrus is covered in blooms and thriving.  I have worked with several irrigation companies over the years, and I can say that I sincerely trust these people.  They told me I did not need a new redo and that saved me thousands.  I don't know what the problem with the buyer beware post was, but I would highly recommend this company.  No, I have no stock in it and these people are not "friends".  Just a good straightforward company.”

- “Thirty came out to fix and work on my irrigation system while I was out of town. My wife was there to handle it. No major issues noted during the work. I came home a few days later to notice the irrigation system running constantly.  I called them up and the Secretary was incredibly unhelpful. She wouldn't even call the owner who helped us out initially. Meanwhile the water was continuing to run.   Finally I got a call back and the owner sent someone the next morning. No charge.  They get a downgrade because of the Secretary and the poor customer service she provided. Overall work was well done and I have no issues.  Edit number two: A bill just arrived despite them saying they would not charge me. Downgrading to one star. Will update when it gets resolved.”
- “We had 5 professional bonded irrigation companies bid on installing a new system for us.  #1 Greg showed up without a mask, is not vaccinated and is not interested in getting a shot, or Covid protocols even though Pima County is still under a mask mandate.  #2 They were the least flexible and took the longest to come out for an appointment by 3 weeks.  He was supposed to show up between 9 - 12, but showed up around 8am without so much as phone call.  #3.  His was the highest bid out of 5 (by a long shot), and one of the other bids came from a  high end landscape architect (the second highest) at $1,500 cheaper than Tolson.  We don't support businesses who Covid blind, and those who scam customers with "insult pricing".”
- “These guys are scam artists! They came to fix a leak in my system. They do not give you any estimate. They just start working on the problem. Then they send you a bill in the mail. If you ask them how much it will cost they just repeat that they will send you a bill in the mail. They fixed the problem but they charge way too much. Their minimum charge is around $95! Buyer beware!”

Plus this station was mentioned on the news for having compromised card readers.”

Then I look at the best by date on the packages and they are well over the best by date. I picked a bag of sun flower seeds instead. When I went up to the register the guy asked if that was all, I said well I was gonna get some candy but it's past the best by date. He says that candy would survive a nuclear bomb and be o.k. I leave with my sunflower seeds and out of curiosity compare the use by date on the ones I just bought to the empty bag in my car. The empty bag in my car (bought somewhere else) doesn't expire for almost 4 more months. The bag I just bought expires in 8 days. Fresh? I'd say they have been sitting for a couple months.”

- “I had a conference up in Scottsdale and my company rented a car for me. The rental car was a Hyundai Accent with no issues, full tank of gas, and the Hertz person even noted a few scratches/dents that I completely missed. Getting the vehicle was a nice and easy process, no hassle and very friendly staff.  When i went to return the car, it was slightly passed the hours  but luckily there was a person there late and he helped me return the car even though it was after the work hours. The return was very simple as well and I felt very bad for making the person stayed a little extra late because I needed a receipt and the printer was not being cooperative. I will definitely recommend anyone who needs a rental from here.  TLDR; great staff, easy process, and fine rentals!”
- “I want to say Joshua Hogan was awesome in helping me with my rental. I would use them again. I am giving them 5 stars for the customer service and Josh being there to help me get through difficult times.”
- “This HLE location is the best!  Josh is always helpful and customer service oriented.  If things are not just right, he will make them right.”

## 1★ samples (Negative Reviews)
- “WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! To start out, they gave me a car with a faulty tire. It was only a couple days before I had to put air in it and a week before it became completely flat. I called the INA location asking what my options were. I was given the option of either driving it all the way across town (on a completely flat tire) or having it towed. I asked if I would be able to change the flat tire myself in order to avoid having a tow. I was told no because I "wasn't authorized to do so." I then asked if I would be charged for the tow and they said as long as I didn't run anything over and the damage on the tire was not my fault I would not be charged for the tow. So this pretty much left me with the option of a tow. Upon leaving the second rental car at the auto body shop where my car was getting work done I was told hertz would give me a call later that day to close out my account. I waited a week and no call had come. So I called them and was told I would receive a call back later that day. Call never came. I called back a second time two days later and was told the same thing. After calling three times and being told I would receive the callback that never came I decided to just assume my account had been closed out. Almost two weeks after I returned the car I receive a bill from them for $92. I called to see what the bill was and I was told it was for towing expenses. I let the woman on the phone know that I wasn't supposed to be charged for that instead of looking further into the problem she blew me off and pretty much told me I was SOL. I only chose this company because they were recommended by the insurance. Now I know better than to do business with hertz. if I could give them zero stars, I would.”
- “These people lied and refused to work with me. They said there was a $200 deposit when the confirmation said there was no deposit and wouldn't take my debit card because of the new charge. They even said I booked third party so I couldn't cancel with them there. Rent from enterprise, I never had a problem and got free upgrades a lot. Budget was good to. Don't use hertz especially this location.”
- “When we made reservations for a vehicle, it stated 100% cancellation up to time of vehicle pick up.  We decided to cancel 48 hr before pick up only to find there's a $50 penalty to cancel!  I am livid.  I also found out that they charge $13+ to add a spouse to drive.   I have been working with Enterprise for years.  When you reserve a vehicle and need to cancel up to the day/time of pick up; there's no penalty.  They also add spouse automatically.  They are the BEST!”

## Tips from customers
Rented a car from this location for 24 hours while my car was being serviced. I selected the loss/damage waiver on the rental.  Dropped it off one hour late and was charged for the extra hour, as expected.  But I was also charged for a full 48 hours on the loss and damage waiver, even though the car was returned only one hour late.  Not cool.  I will not be using Hertz again.

## 1★ samples (Negative Reviews)
- “I rented a house through Cobb Realty's property management division for one year.  For the most part the experience was good, except upon moving in and moving out- which completely negates anyother positive experience I have had with the company.   The house I rented had not been rented out before and the people living there right before us were the owners.  The house was clearly not cleaned or inspected by Cobb realty before we went to pick up the keys.  I called to state that the property was not proffessionally cleaned as I had been told it would be and they sent someone out right away, which was good, but they did a terrible job, which was bad, but I just needed to move in and move on with my life so I let it slide.   During the course of the year we lived there, any concerns we had were promptly addressed, I will give them credit for that.  So if you plan on never moving from the property you are renting, maybe go with Cobb. But if you ever plan to move out, beware! Once we turned in our notice that we would not be renewing our lease we began being asked to show the property to prospective tenants, on our own, with no representative from the company.  I am too nice, so I agreed to it until my husband spoke to Cobb and let them know we wouldn't be doing that anymore.  It just seems really unproffessional. On the day of our move out inspection I returned the keys and the house was inspected. I had the home professionally cleaned and the yard completely beautified.  The next day I received a call asking for our forwarding address to send our security deposit to, I asked if we would be receiving the full deposit back and was told that we would.   Now a week later I have received a call telling me that the house wasn't cleaned well enough for them, stating items that I watched my cleaning lady clean, were not clean and that items that they had not told me had to be cleaned, like can lights on an at least 16 foot high ceiling (which were among the many items left dirty before we moved in) and that we would be responsible to pay for the cleaning of these items.  Ok fine, whatever.  But then they proceeded to tell me we would be responsible for replacing some blinds that were already damaged before we moved in and I am quite sure I marked that on my move in inspection, although they said I did not and also that we would be responsible for paying for broken outlets that were broken when we moved in..... and so on and so on.   The hassle that I am going through with this company is worse than any property management company I've ever rented from, I have never not received my whole security deposit back.  I was a very good tenant and to be treated like this now that our business relationship has come to an end is just plain rude.”
- “owners BEWARE !! got a call from utility company early - mid September, they claimed wanting to place service back into my name. i told them no my renter is responsible for their utility's. i was then informed they received notification from my renter of move out date..so i then call cobb reality asking why am i hearing this from utility company & not my property mgt company that is being paid to inform me of this information. excuse manager handling my account was away on leave.. ( wow ) so i asked who is handling my account while my manager is on leave..they put me through to a employee who couldn't give me an answer  but informed me of a new additional fee i need pay ( bed bug )??? i said if property has bed bugs,, renter not owner need pay she disagreed.. so i started looking for new property mgt company..  i am fed up with cobbs fees.. new contract fee, advertising fee. administrative fee.. with their monthly management fee..  by the way in year 2017 i have had 3 different property managers @ cobb.. renter moved out as planned before oct 31st she left property in great condition .  took cobb 3 months to get last renter in ( under contract ) & got less than asking Price wanted 750.00 & got 675.00.. had to take the loss because it is better to loose a little money than foreclosure.. or to keep paying  a mortgage on an empty house 1/4 year. & /or longer  now all is well went with new management company.. no fees just monthly 10 %.. they rented house for more 800.00$ in just 1 day.. funny thing is im going to get Decembers rent from new company before i get Octobers rent from cobb. they do not return calls barely answer the phone,, all ya can do is leave messages ..”
- “Cobb Realty authorized entry to my home to a prospective tenant at any time. When the prosepctive tenant came to my home around 6:30pm they attempted entry around the border of my home as well as garage entry.  They claimed that employee, Stacey thought the property was vacant and authorized them entry.  Upon arrival they still must have thought it was still vacant despite my car being in the driveway and my dog barking in the home.  I thought I was being robbed. I was fearful and upset when I found out Cobb had authorized eveything.  To my knowlege, they are not even supposed to be sending perspective tenants to homes unescorted much less after normal busniess hours.   This type of unescourted permission to enter a property could result in theft of owner valuables such as appliances and house furnishings as well as personal thefts.  I do not recommend using Cobb Realty as a property manager for the security of the goods in your home and personal safety. The free access in which they allow people into your home is frightening and a liability.  I contacted the owner, Keith Cobb and he stands firm that my privacy was not violated and their actions were appropriate.”

And don't count on the lousy 'So called maintenance men they hire anybody off the street and give them a shirt and welcome them in to patch up what's broke. It will most likely fall apart or leak 2 weeks later. HSL properties and corporate office is a joke! If you want to make a complaint to them they won't return your call either. The ceiling in my walk way has also been falling apart and you can see the molding for weeks, almost an embarrassment when you invite people over. I give this place 1 start because it deserves it. Save yourself by not moving here!!!!!”
- “I wish I could give Somerpointe a 0 rating. Other folks have covered it, the roach problem is insane and the folks here are not helpful. When I complained about the roaches in the apartment, I was met with "living in Tucson, that's normal". When my car was broken into and the front office was aware, but didn't care to check in, when I called I was met with "did you have a domestic dispute?". I believe Somerpointe only cares about the money and not their tenants at all.”
- “I moved in one week ago.  The first night I killed 7 roaches.  The second night at least 20, and then 20 plus per day.  They had someone come in and spray and bait the place on my fourth day.  Still killing at least 10 roaches per day.  Now I'm feeling things crawling on me in bed and fear that it is also bedbug infested.  It is unlivable.  My last apartment was an HSL property that I never had a problem with.  Stay away from this property for your own safety.”

- “RENTERS BEWARE!!! DO NOT BOTHER!!! I booked a pod on their "national website" and scheduled for next day delivery.  Everything looked great except it had a TBD for the time it would be delivered and the customer service (in Florida) was already closed to get a more specific time of delivery.   I called on the day the Pod was to be delivered and talked to someone back east and they told me that the "window" was between 7 and 10 a.m.  At 10:30 a.m. I called back and asked for an updated and the operator (again back east) said she would call the Tucson office manager and get a better time line and have him/her call me back.  ..."Crickets"!! is what I heard back !!  At 2:00 p.m., again, called and they told me that they were running behind and that they could not tell me what time they would be there to drop off the pod.  Finally being a little frustrated I was shocked that the East office was open at 4:00 pm only for them to tell me that they would not deliver until Monday morning!!!  No Calls from anyone in Tucson!!!!  They STRING you along until you are at their mercy.  Not here!!  I was lucky to have scheduled movers that were able to use their truck and move my furniture out and hold for 2 days.  I called COOL BOX STORAGE and they scheduled me for delivery and pick up.  If I could rate this company (PODS) a negative 5 star I  certainly would.”

They had all the wrong account information and explained it was all their fault and not mine. I spent 45 minutes one day and 50 minutes two days later trying to get everything cleared up. AN HOUR AND A HALF ON THE PHONE ARE YOU SERIOUS? Then PODS tells me they can't pick up and deliver until Sept 9th when I've been trying to schedule a move on the first of Sept for days but was held up by the bogus account information. They tell me the local PODS facility will text or call me to get it done any sooner, like tomorrow The 2nd of Sept.”

- “I can't say enough positive things about Scotia Group and the community I reside in.  The staff here is super friendly and professionally managed by a wonderful company.   I'm moving to another Scotia community in a couple of months because I love the way they manage their communities.  They get residents involved like a community.”
- “I was an employee of the company a year ago and had a good experience working for Scotia. My property changed management and I ended parting ways after a couple years with them.  I have now returned as a client and my experience has also been good.  Mrs. Pacheco has been incredibly helpful helping me find a beautiful apartment for me and my family. I needed an apartment really fast and the ladies at The Yardz as well as Arcadia Park have worked really hard to get us in on time.  Thank you Scotia team from Catalina and Sofia!”

- “I have contacted Scotia Group several times to correct an issue that I was experiencing at one of their Tucson properties.  I was instructed to contact Shar and she would be able to assist me.  I never received a call or email back from her when I contacted her on three separate occasions.  Unless Shar is no longer working for the company I find it hard to understand to understand why she did not contact me back to resolve my concerns in a professional manner.  Instead I was forced to retain an attorney and deal directly with Scotia's attorney.  The legal fees probably cost them more money than it would to just correct my issue or to even have one of their managers contact me back. What a shame!   Only after threatening legal action did Scotia start cooperating.  They are unfortunately not professionally managed and the turn over rate is indicative of the culture they created.  I would recommend another property management company when deciding where to live.”
- “Save yourself a headache, if you are wanting to rent and you see the Scotia sign keep going.  People are finding this out the hard way but that does not mean you can not learn from their mistakes.”
- “I have, unfortunately, now lived at 2 different properties managed by Scotia.  My first experience was very poor. The carpet in my apartment was old and in horrible shape. It was affecting my health, and my doctor requested they change the flooring. They would do it, but only if I paid for the new flooring. Flooring should be the responsibility of the owner.  Where I live now was previously owned by another management company (I would never move to a property owned by Scotia). Scotia recently purchased the property. They are now randomly not allowing tenants to renew their lease because they want to upgrade the units. The way they are handling the situation is very poor. The new staff is also not friendly.  When looking for an apartment, if it is owned by Scotia, I would turn around and find another place.”

Owner is a wise ass, I said I was going to complain to corporate and he told me, "he was the owner and it would do no good."  So here I am hopefully some one read this and do business elsewhere...........................................”
- “I've  been here a few times and the inside is usually unclean.  Today (at 9:30 am) there was no toilet paper in the women's room at all (booth stalls) no paper towels either. The kids play area was filthy - all the tables were dirty and had trash in them. The floor was also dirty.  The young guy at the register was beyond nice and friendly. I wish his place was nicer.”
- “Came inside to eat as the drive-thru was long.  The guy who took our order took forever and we had to repeat our order several times.  Waited 20 minutes for our food.  My husband's burger wasn't cooked well.  My son's order was wrong.  I know it's McDonald's,  but still....  Will think twice about coming back to this one.”

- “Stay far away from HSL. Their upper management is the most unprofessional management I have ever encountered. There is so much nepotism in the company that they'll fire valuable employees to keep their family members in the company even if they do WELL below average work. Don't work for this company, don't rent from this company. You will regret it. They've fired 3 maintenance workers the last month for the most ridiculous reasons. Go somewhere else, they'll pay you better than HSL ever will.”
- “I am writing this review after having left an HSL property a year and a half ago.  At that time I had nothing to compare HSL to in Tucson.  However, I do now.  In my humble opinion, HSL is the most poorly run multi-family management company that I have ever experienced anywhere and now Tucson is a testament to that.  I diligently tried to work with the corporate office on improving the property where I lived.  I was able to have poisonous trees planted in the Encantada dog parks changed out after meeting with a man from corporate.  Kudos for doing that but why were the trees planted in a dog park that cause dogs kidney failure in the first place???  Past that, this corporate office is a bunch of slum lords that create a facade to lure people in and then refuse to work or care for their residents.  It is a shame because they turn a blind eye to the really bad things happening at the communities while promoting doing "good" for the Tucson community at large.”
- “The manager, Jessica Vogt needs to learn how to treat the residents here respectably, keep the place free of theft and crime, and get rent rates correct.  She fails at all that but she sure knows how to threaten the residents well and put harassing letters on their doors telling them how she decided to add an extra $25 to person's rent for the month.  This is how you will  be treated by her if you move here, despicably!  People are moving out or living uncomfortable here because of her nasty nature and treatment.  HSL you need to teach her how to treat the residents here better or replace her with someone who does.”

I was greeted by the receptionist checked in and waiting maybe 7 minutes for my turn. The lab tech and girl who checked me in were very nice and did everything correctly sanitized, gloved, verified. Which I completely appreciate it!   When I left about three more people were in waiting area, they are open until 5pm which is nice for people to have later time. Thank you! Hope all my future experiences are like this.”

- “AVOID THIS LAB LIKE THE PLAGUE!  My doctor ordered a blood test that requires me to stop taking prescribed medication for a week first.  Obviously, I need that medication or it wouldn't be prescribed.  This lab messed up the test TWICE.  First, they didn't draw enough blood.  Then, they used the wrong tube.  As a result, they tripled the amount of time I have to be off much needed medication.  They also tripled the amount of time needed for a diagnosis and appropriate treatment.  For all I know, my condition may have worsened during that time.  I've had to repeatedly take time off work.  In my opinion, the employees at this lab are completely incompetent and need to be fired.  I, for one, am taking my business to a competitor.”
- “I had no problem with the blood draw (2 tubes) for extensive tests.  I made an appt online & was seen within 10 minutes of that appt ~ phlebotomist was very well trained & professional!   My issue is with reviewing the results on the SQ "portal". I can view them with no problem however they aren't printable.   And no it's not my computer/printer!  All documents I needed from other places printed with no problem. I also tried printing from my phone & the page where u have to tap "I understand " to switch to the 3rd party area will not allow that to happen.  A total useless company has sold SQ a NOT user friendly system.   This is our health people, not ordering a salad at Wendy's!   Also at the end of the lab report is an area that for one important blood test my doc ordered states "Due to a laboratory incident, we are unable to perform this test.  The ordering provider will be contacted by our client service department to determine options for recollection ".  Really??? More $$$ for SQ to collect from 2 insurance companies, another appt for me to make & another useless unprintable result from your "portal" What exactly was the "incident " that occurred??    SQ has almost a monopoly on blood draws in the whole city of Tucson - a city of over 1/2 million people.  Plus any questions are to be addressed to an office in Tempe, AZ!   Anyone care to guess how that works if you wish to talk to a live person??   By the way, please SQ don't respond to this review with your generic, cookie cutter response that does nothing for the people that make your company a success & mega profitable!!    Fix the problem & get back to basics -----simple, concise blood tests with no "incidents" & a user friendly "portal" that we can print to become more informed before we go to a doc's 10 minute visit to discuss the blood test!”
- “I couldn't even get someone to check and see if they had an order for my bloodwork before going in for an appointment I made online. I'll pay out of pocket and use Labcorp going forward. Horrible customer service at this location. I should have checked their bad reviews before wasting my time. I made a call to their corporate office in Phoenix, not sure what good it'll do but someone needed to know how bad they were.”

- “Talk about a poor experience. Someone actually waggled a finger in my fathers face and said not to call unless it is an emergency. Patient plans and care are not communicated to patient or family causing everyone to feel forgotten. Medical issues seem to be ignored,  someone with severely swollen and red arms and legs should not have to wait a week to even ask the Dr about it.”
- “This place is beyond terrible. My mother is a patient there. Our experience in the 2 short weeks that she's been there has been a complete nightmare. Starting with the person who answers the phone all the way to the top. Getting help or answers is impossible. Nobody answers their phones and nobody returns your calls. We've never received a call from the attending physician to inform us of her condition. Staff leave the phone in the patients room out of reach so when you try to reach your loved one they can't pick up your call. They serve terrible food and act irritated if you ask for anything. Patients are neglected. I can't wait to get my mother out of there. If you have a choice don't go there and don't let anyone you know be placed there either.”
- “They don't return calls/emails, don't coordinate with POA on ANYTHING! They don't communicate between the different departments. My aunt still hasn't been started on physical therapy. Due to COVID I don't even know what's going on inside except she states the food is nasty and cold, they haven't started her on special diet she requires. Don't put your lives one here.”

I hope this place goes out of business!!!!! If I could give it negative 5 stars I would!”
- “This review is based on a recent manicure, which was mediocre.  Concerns of cleanliness in this salon, The service tables are in desperate need of a good scrub!  Not sure about the sanitation of the tools used. The man (I believe to be the owner) was the nail tech I ended up with.  He was not interested in listening to what I was asking of him.  I had to ask several times to use the file to even and smooth the edges of my nails, the polish applied ended up being extremely thick and ended up under my nails.  I asked for a tool to remove the excess polish - he ignored me.  I'm not sure that I'll return to this salon.”

This McDonald's is in for big trouble if another business ever comes out here!    Today we went inside because being the 4th of July, the Queen Donuts was closed.  We just wanted a quick breakfast.   The food is standard McDonald's fare, usually the iced coffee is what I stop for.  It can be really good.  Today they put so much vanilla in it - it was white.  A bit (!) too sweet today.  Please note that fast food is not fast at this McDonald's.   I don't even know why.  There were 8 people working (that I could see).  Maybe there is a more efficient way they could do things?  Seems like 8 would be enough....but I have never worked in a restaurant,  so I don't know if 8 is enough!  It gets 1 star for being here when you are desperate!”
- “Terrible experience, order was completely wrong. When trying to explain to them my order was wrong they asked for a receipt that they never gave to me. Very expensive for getting breakfast for 2. Tried to tell me that I never ordered what I did but repeated everything back to me. Won't ever return here. Manager was very rude as well and wouldn't even show me my receipt to see what she charged me for.”
- “If I could give less stars I would. Price gouging because it's closer to Old Tucson, bad customer service and the mgr ugh doesn't need to be in charge at all.we ordered 2 combos and they only gave us 1 fry and argued that we should not have but 1 fry after paying almost double from another McDonald's location.  Ridiculous!”

Oooh, they got the McRib! =) Nasty place and rude employees Worst place to eat. Convince from my house. But RUDE people working there. Always have to wait. Or missed up order. If u can, AVOID THIS MCDONALDS It's McDonalds. Fries are always bussin' and they're somewhat quick. I dig it.

- “My husband hates going to the doctor. He suffered for three days with a sinus infection and bronchitis before he finally relented and agreed to see a doctor. Our regular PCP was out of town due to a family emergency so we opted for Banner Urgent Care on Thornydale.   I loved that we could check in online rather than just showing up and having to sit around. We checked in at 8:00am for and 8:45am appointment. We arrived about 8:35 and waited only a couple minutes before we were seen.   Donna  Rowe, the Nurse Practitioner that we saw was fabulous. She's so kind and gentle and genuinely concerned about her patients. We were in and out in less than half and hour and everything was handled so quickly and efficiently. The staff were great.  We'd certainly come back for urgent needs or when we can't get in to see our PCP.”
- “I have been here twice once for my daughter and once for myself. We had the best care the PA Lisa Ritter-Baker is wonderful! The staff is great and everyone really cared about us and wanted to make us better. It was a great experience, hopefully we don't have to go back cause being sick is no fun but if you need an urgent care I would highly recommend this urgent care to anyone!”

## 1★ samples (Negative Reviews)
- “They literally have no idea what they're doing. I went in for a routine earwax cleaning and the nurse used a water syringe. She shot the water so hard into my ear it LITERALLY MADE A TEAR IN MY EARDRUM!! I came here to IMPROVE my health not make it worse!! Never in my life have I had a doctor injure me. I am seriously looking into legal action for this - save yourself the time and money and go to a real doctor. I highly recommend Southern Arizona Urgent Care, I visited them after Banner and they told me why my ears were ringing since my horrible "cleaning".”
- “Update: yup! I got the generic computer generated response from banner. Hahaha what a joke.   The female Russian provider at this location provides HORRIBLE SERVICE! My husband went specifically there through the VA recommendation to use as urgent need for his ear issue. He was treated in a manner that NO ONE should ever be treated. After he asked if she could try to get the wax out that was causing him pain and hearing loss, she yelled at him, raised her hands, yelled, "NO GO SEE A SPECIALIST!" And walked out on his already paid visit. The nurse walking in as this happened was extremely embarrassed. My husband said, "she sounds like a Russian, couldn't translate into English well and is extremely rude."  The nurse (looking scared) said, "Yup, that's just the way she is."  She was trying to keep her voice down so as nit to be heard when she apologized to him. He told her it wasn't her fault.  He basically got charge our copay and the insurance was charged their fee for ABSOLUTELY NOTHING but to be yelled at and treated in an abusive manner. People who don't like working with people should not be in this type of environment where people are in urgent need of proper care! This person needs to be replaced!”
- “This place is awful. I believe there are a total of 3 people working in the entire building and the lady at the reception desk keeps taking personal phone calls right in the lobby. While I was waiting another lady came over and told me to just go sit down until the desk girl came back because she didn't know how to do check in's. I did their on line check in for 9:55 AM and am still waiting for a doctor at 10:39 AM. So that system is mostly useless. It's not even that busy. The place does not seem well run or well staffed. I'm very glad I was here for myself and did not need to bring my children here which I will NEVER do. Not pleased with this location at all.”

Considered cancelling but had to hope for the best because of timing.  Fortunately, a very professional young man, showed up on time with the correct materials and expertise and did a great job on my Audi A5.  Drove 1000 miles the next weekend in rain with no issues.

It blew off while I was driving down the road. I contacted customer service and provided extensive photos. They told me I removed the trim myself and that they wouldn't remove the trim (although you could see on the glass where the trim used to rest). They have no true customer service number. Buyer beware!”
- “Love the name and that's where it stops!  A poorly run-company that uses sub-contractors for everything!  I spoke to two customer service reps calling from two different area codes in the space of two days.  Both were pleasant, asked extensive questions about make, model, window damaged, etc.  Took a half-day off work to meet with service guy, he showed up with the wrong materials and informed me that I would have to go to the dealer (Safelite replaced a window for me and they showed up with everything they needed for the job and only charged a tiny bit more, use Safelite!!)!  When I called customer service to voice my dissatisfaction and get a refund as I was charged in advance of getting the work done, she got angry with me!!!! And, she was unable to provide me with proof of my refund, so now I have to place a formal complaint with the credit card company, oy, what a headache!  Stay away from the Windshield Guru, they are not a spiritually evolved, responsible company as their name implies!!!!! They don't even rate one-star : (”
- “Never get involved with this company on either side!  These people are users.  Our shop used to be an independent contractor for Glass Guru.  The Glass Guru called our shop for a replacement on one of their customers cars.  We contacted the customer to schedule an appointment for the next day.  Right before we were about to do the replacement Auto Glass Guru contacted us to cancel the replacement because they realized they didn't charge enough for the job.  The customer then contacted us because he still needed the work done.  After completing the job we received a call from the Auto Glass Guru insinuating that we stole the replacement from them and that they would not be sending us work any more.  Furthermore, they the General Manager Bud is refusing to pay us on previous jobs for "The money they lost on the job that we stole".  Do no use this company! Keep it local!”

I just work with old people who are at risk and doing my part at staying home. I was waiting for my mail to come to my door but it accidentally got sent to the office and the manager did not want to help me a RESIDENT that always pays my bills on time by putting the packages outside my door so that i do not have to put anyone in danger if i did so happen to have the virus. How this fucking lady wanted me to run out to some bush in the front of the office to grab my package and told me that shes not responsible if it gets taken. WTF kind of customer service is this?!? DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD URNED MONEY ON THIS HELL HOLE OF AN APARTMENT. This is just one of the many things that has happened to me living here. And if it wasn't for the lease and i wasn't having money issues because of this whole stupid COVID-19 outbreak i would have been out of here months ago. Please do not waste your money.”
- “I lived here for two years, and this was easily one of the biggest mistakes I have made during my time at UA. It is very cheap, affordable housing, but please be aware of the trade-off. Staff is extremely rude and deceitful. Initially they will be nice enough to coerce you into signing a lease; however, with time you will find them to be extremely unprofessional. The shuttles do NOT run most of the time as they are not well maintained. When things break, do not expect them to get fixed. Most Gateway residents party all of the time making it difficult to study. Wi-Fi goes out often along with the electricity. There were two instances we had no water because management forgot to pay the water bill! Overall, the place is pretty bad.

Plus, I have an email where they have asked me to move out because I am complaining so much about their refusal to fulfill their obligations under the terms of the lease and the Landlord Tenant Act, not to mention the Americans with Disabilities Act. Underage alcohol consumption is rampant here, and neither management nor Tucson Police seem to care. Parents, if you want your students to graduate, don't let them rent here. This place is cheap, and you get what you pay for. I had to call the cops again this morning, when my next door neighbor yelled, "Die, die" and I had no idea what he meant. This place advertises as "luxury", but the walls are so thin that a private conversation is next to impossible. Just stay away from this place. It's not worth the low price.”

- “Excellent smile from front desk so I felt ok when the homeless good looking guy came in to sit on stool and to collect water from machine to wash his hair in front of the restaurant. Their competitor was too crowded so we came in to this clean restaurant and ordered 1 chicken sandwich and 1 combo so my husband could get his coffee. The manager came to our table and said, they mistakenly made salad instead of sandwiches. I told her to leave it. We had 2 boxes of free chicken salads from Burger King. That's my 2nd visit in past 15 years at this chain restaurant.  I'll return to this one for sure, not to expect another free box of chicken salad, just to return to their favor, as God said, take care of your neighbors, so good deeds need to be returned and more warmth of human nature will be exposed.”
- “Fries and chicken tenders where good and crispy. Don't know why this one is rated so low. Very nice staff as well.”
- “Efficient, friendly and they always get my order right!! Even factoring in the longer drive from my location, it's always much faster to go to this location as opposed to the one on Grant that is chronically understaffed and extremely rude.”

- “Super big fan normally stopped by quick before work and they gave me the wrong order the girl who handed out even specifically told them it was wrong took the wrong item out just for her to put it back in like a different sandwich which is bullshit maybe if I looked like a cholo she would have been more willing to help”
- “Please do not visit this store! The store is very dirty inside and out. Cant even think about what it looks like behind the counter. The staff is  usually standing around avoiding the dirty tables and trash's that need to be taken care of. I did take my order home to only discover the Chicken Sandwich was still frozen. I then remembered the person at the counter made mention to the other workers that the chicken sandwich was missing in the order. A few seconds later it was placed in the bag. I am very sorry that the name Burger King is on this building. Please save your time, money and frustration and try a different location.”

- “I do not recommend this place at least the sales person Jesus as he did not do the proper protocol for safety before I left the yard with my new trailer my brakes did not work and I was told to bring a 2 inch ball when the trailer required 2 5/16 which he did not check he had me pull this trailer which I could've killed somebody I do not recommend trailers plus at all”
- “Good trailers, terrible service. On June 2018 I purchased a Dump Trailer from Clayton at the Trailers Plus Tucson location. Upon receiving the Trailer Plus yearly reminder via email telling me to bring in my trailer for a free inspection I called the Tucson facility to make an appointment and was told by the shop personnel that he was too busy working on a "trailer that had burned up" and for me to call back in a few weeks. I found that odd and never did follow up to try to make an appointment. Recently, my Lower Hydraulic Hose began to leak so I called the Tucson location to make an appointment for repair. On Monday 8/9 I called the Tucson location and was forwarded to the corporate Call Center in Idaho who answered telling me that the Tucson location is closed on Mondays. The Call Center Rep (Carolyn) said she would give a message to the Tucson location to call me. I never receive a call. On Tuesday 8/10, I again called the Tucson location and again was forwarded to the corporate Call Center in Idaho. The Call Center Rep (Denise) said she would give a message to the Tucson location to call me. I never receive a call. On Wednesday 8/11, I again called the Tucson location and again was forwarded to the corporate Call Center in Idaho. The Call Center Rep (Logan) said he would give a message to the Tucson location to call me. I never receive a call. It appears that calling the Tucson location directly always results in the call rolling-over to the corporate Call Center. I feel that having to call for assistance 3 times with no response is not a good business practice. Since I cannot find a way to have anybody from Trailers Plus give me assistance, my only option is to now turn to social media. I have left messages on Yelp, Facebook, and even left a message on LinkedIn with the Trailers Plus CEO, Michael Snow, in an attempt to simply get my trailer repaired. Like I said...."Good trailers, terrible service."”
- “So my first review was deleted--so I'm going to write it again.  I bought a car hauler from Trailer's Plus in September of 2017.  30 days later the trailer was stolen.  The trailer had a ball lock which stops somebody from stealing the trailer by using the hitch.  I bought the ball lock set from Trailer's Plus.  The trailer was stored in the ally behind my business.  There was no evidence of any theft or lock parts on the ground.  Trailer's Plus and or their staff have a master key for ball locks.  The fact that this was stolen within 30 days, there was no damaged parts on the ground, and the trailer was 24' long--hard to hide, makes me wonder if someone with internal knowledge of the transaction--knew where to find the trailer and had the ability to defeat the locks had a hand in the theft.  Go ahead trailer's plus--delete the review--but that's my thoughts--anyone else with similar experience?  Oh by the way--a replacement is 4k more because its a 2017 vs. a 2018.”

- “Wonderful service! Great job on jeep. Offers military discount. I go every other week.”
- “This has to be the friendliest car wash place ever. I went back several times to see if I just happened to run into nice people that day but everyone is like that! They are running around, working hard and they are organized. The car washes are great also. Can't beat this place.”

- “I got deluxe cleaning yesterday for $40 and my car does not look much better than it did before the cleaning. There is stains and dirty spots on it. They are so rushed that they don't really ay attention. On top of this my aux to iPhone connector was stolen. I'm really upset. Avoid!!”
- “We have a upgraded membership on both our vehicles. When we just do the exterior wash and then have the vehicles dried they are half A.. drying. I decided to have there "most expensive" detail done and expected excellent detail from the way they talked it up. That was not the case. Vehicle still had mud on the exterior, interior still had dirt on the floor mats and door sills. Door panels not wiped at all. Mirrors still had mud on them and stains. Chrome had dirt smears/water spots everywhere. The best part is the vehicle was supposed to be hand waxed not spray waxed. I was lied too and told it was waxed when it wasn't waxed at all. Poor service and will probably cost them 2 monthly memberships.”
- “I went to Mister Carwash and was greeted by an attendant who helped me with the machine. She waved me through and I entered the wash. I heard some ruckus in the car wash and when I got out i looked at my car and saw that my roof rack was missing. Then I told the attendant and he ran and got the rack. It was completely destroyed in addition to a bike rack attachment on it.   They said they would file a claim and let me know 3-5 days later if it was approved. They denied the claim saying my rack was on "crooked". Yeah right. My car was scratched and $400 worth of equipment destroyed.  It was neglect and poor training to waive my car through given this type of damage would occur.”

## Tips from customers
Beautiful day!!! Wish they had a multi car discount:( Unfortunately, the 3 day rainy day  guarantee is no more:( I'm going to have to find a new spot! Manager interior specials! Wow! Nicest waiting area with complimentary popcorn and coffee. Even a tv for the kids! Fast and easy! You can sit in the car! Complimentary popcorn! Horrible experience. Cheap basic wash.. This place does not do a thorough job, very disappointed for the second time Upgrading to 15.00 rather than the extra 5.00 gets you a much better cleaning, exterior and interior! Money well spent! If you plan on getting more than a basic wash, negotiate the price of the add ons. They're willing to do more for less than the pac Negotiate the add ons like seat cleaning etc. Great job as always Great People, great deal, great wash I go 3to 5 times a week and always feel welcome Good place

Na gave me a great pedicure, too!  It's a pleasant, happy, clean atmosphere. Very nice people who know their craft!  I recommend Vinny's highly!”

- “I've had my nails for 12 days exactly, I don't do hard labor but I'm a little annoyed that after paying $45 for my set how weak my nails are. The second day I had them the thumb cracked off, a week ago I was carrying my purse and my nail flew off like if I had the set for a month it would be more understandkng, and today the third nail flew off too. It doesn't hurt when they fly off which is a little disappointing because they weren't put on well.”
- “If I could give a zero, I would. I went in for a full set, and the lady in the front to the left refused to prove what I asked for ( name of HAI on her teal cart). She did an overlay in which I told her several times to do a full set. Less than a day later all the acrylic from her overlay had broke on several nails. I came back in and showed her the poor quality of her work and was yelled at by her. She argued and blamed the nail polish and said it was my fault because they were old (yet she did the work less than a week prior) Let me add that it originally took 2.5 hours for a the original work and pedi, and I was the only customer. Maybe if she focused on her work instead of gossiping and arguing with the customers, but she is the problem....HORRIBLE service. I did also read another customers review in which it stated no record of her visit to nail salon, I can prove this is an accurate review on the correct shop as it is on my bank statement...  Her idea of fixing it, was covering it up with a different color of white polish....”
- “Terrible customer service. Very rude females working there that talk bad about people that go there to try to get their nails done. We ended up leaving because they didn't want to fix my friend's nails and no one who spoke better English could explain why they just all collectively could not care at all about explaining or making her feel better. We walked out of that place feeling so rejected and confused”

Doesn't do dry and after less than a week of wax the cotton fell out and it's getting clogged. They don't take returns or exchanges!!! Also guy treated me like I was a stupid female that should be at home barefoot and pregnant not out buying a ecig adapter”
- “Attempted to return a vape pen charger that worked "once" and the owner refused an exchange.  Ask for a receipt if you buy from here because they don't offer them to their customers. Even so, it won't help you.  Secondly, other products purchased here have been faulty and they don't offer an exchange or refund.  Buyer beware!   The service level exhibited by the owner today was unacceptable. You get what you pay for.  That being said, Never returning here.  Plenty of other vape shops on Ina, I suggest you go to others for better quality and service.”
- “Yes I went there to get a bag of tobacco and  then I went to look at some knives and it was like you're bothering the guy that works there so my godson said oh sorry that we made you to your job and he told him to go fuck himself and this is not the first time he's done this to him he's talked he's made derogatory comments about our God in the bag of tobacco with stale dry I'd rather go to stickies and pay a little bit more there's a hell of a lot nicer”

Every time I've ever ordered online at this location , I show up to pick it up and it hasn't even been started. The employees just act annoyed and tell me to wait and I usually wait 5 minutes or so before it's ready.  no difference in time between ordering online and in person.”

On Sunday the orange chicken was so spicy I had to put ice on my lips to stop the burning. The pieces of chicken where all small so i could not remove the crust for my Godson sobhe could eat it. I called the restaurant and was told you get what you get. I guess i will be looking for a new place to buy orange chicken from.”

- “They keep the rest rooms locked. You have to find a salesperson then wait and wait until they come and unlock the door. Not a great customer experience. And the floor was dirty and toilet paper dispenser was empty.   The chart that shows when they last cleaned it was dated 3/7, it is now the end of June. Manager said they don't have time to fill out the chart, what no time for an employee to sign their initials? Thats a bogus excuse.  It shows what they think of their customers. Sloppy and unprofessional management.”
- “The bathroom was horrific!! I doubt they clean it!. Dead crickets, toilets were so disgusting, sink had hair and just filth all over I didn't even want the bottom of shoes to touch the floor in there. The whole store as a matter of fact was filthy but that bathroom was by far one of THE MOST DISGUSTING BATHROOMS I HAVE EVER SEEN!!”
- “Bought some spray glue for a project.  Turns out it sat on the shelf for 8 years (date on can from 2008) - the glue never dried and the propellant didn't work right.  So, they don't check their perishable inventory.  Now I know to do it.  Heads up, folks.    However, when I tried to return it for a refund, an employee advised me I had to enter the checkout line with everyone else.  Since it's Christmas  shopping season, the line was literally back to the entry door.  I ended up throwing the product away - wasn't worth the hassle.  Don't shop there much, will likely go there even less now. Not impressed by the lack of concern for seasonal shopping issues - most places have a dedicated customer return area.  This needs attention, Michaels.”

## Tips from customers
Empty! Bless baby Jesus! Download the Michaels app. You can get coupons straight from there! They accept digital coupons!!! They accept digital coupons! You better hold it while you're in the store because it's real tough to get a bathroom they keep them locked up and you must have an escort Can't wait for the jelly rolls !!!!

- “If you are wanting a bank that actually gives true customer-care and is supporting local business and development, this is the best!  Assistant Manager, Anna, is fantastic with customer-care and very active with supporting the local community and business-development!  Being a customer of National Bank of Arizona is like "walking into the light".  I am having to reinvest almost every dime my business(es) makes since it's ramping up so I have a very meager account but you would think that I was a millionaire with them.  And this is NOT because they are desperate for business as their lobby is almost always  more full (with plenty of tellers) than the other banks and their managers always have someone in their office, definitely more than USBank and WellsFargo ever did.  They will not only greet me, get to me fast as for everyone, apology if it's a little wait (wow, I didn't even think the other banks had those words in their vocabulary) and amazingly so, now often have my account pulled up already when I get to the window and call me by first name!!  Thank you, Anna, a true professional who is busy but friendly, professional but polite, efficient but not hurried! Jason, who not only is a top teller but has my account pulled up everytime, calls me by name and asks me how I am! Nabeal, who often goes out of his way to handle anything special and is very professional and friendly. Rebecca, who works very efficiently, goes out of her way if needed and is very consciousness about her work!”

- “I initially went to this bank because they have a trust and investment company and I had just created a trust.  I asked their wealth management people how they would invest my nest egg, performance data so I could compare their results with market benchmarks, and how they would help and protect my wife if I were to pass first.  The answers were  very disappointing but I'm not going to get into details.  Suffice it to say, that I found them to be expensive, an  investment philosophy that was not tailored to my personal situation, and getting information was difficult.  I did not see any added value they would provide   So in order to be a part of their trust division, it was mandated that I use their bank for all my banking needs.  This was where things really fell apart.  Customer service, providing timely access to my own funds, being treated with respect when I complain about deposits, wire transfers, etc were  in a word, terrible. I cannot recommend the branch I went to.     May be the other branches are different, but my advice is:  stay away”
- “i definately do not recommend then for any reason whatsoever. i was traveling all year and didnt go into a branch as i have multiple bank accounts and this was just used as an emergency account if i needed to do a car repair etc, and now the almost $1000 was just given to the state and my account closed for inactivity, but they sure didnt have any problem taking fees out. whats the point of having a bank account when your money is just going to be stolen and given to the govt for no reason, they made a policy change last year and didnt tell me that i have to access it so often, it used to be 3 years. better off just putting your hard earned money in a safe.”
- “Unbelievably poor customer servicing. They told me they would send something out the next day. A week later I checked and they said it would be there that Tuesday. I called again and they said it hadn't been sent out until Monday and would be here this Tuesday. Still nothing. So if you like waiting weeks for mail and don't mind being lied to, this is your place, otherwise save yourself the headache.”

I love the service at this location! The staff is exceptional!

- “This place sssssucks!  Used car salesmen-like salesmen, ordering takes foreeever and they dont give a DAMN!  They must really piss off the company reps they order from. I ordered a 1,200$ Schecter and have had nothing but problems with it since.  Not only that I recieved a virus infused e-mail from the luthier after paying 500$ to for some work, not to mention the scratches he made, though oh so kindly buffed out after I pointed it out.  Yup.”
- “This guy, Tony is nothing more than a crook!!! All you have to do is read all of the reviews. And yes, as someone posted, he is a nightmare to deal with as a vendor of products, he's trying to sell that he has not paid for, lies repeatedly & gives the run-around. At this point, we plan on calling the Tucson Police & pressing charges. We already warned him to return our merchandise immediately. So he's selling essentially stolen property & he will never get any more products from us. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY WITH THIS PLACE! 100% guaranteed to be ripped off!”
- “Wow, what a pile of shit this place is. Or rather, what a complete asshole Tony, the owner of the store, is. I have owned a music store in Tucson, and I will say upfront that other employees of this place are kind, knowledgeable, and do a good job. But after months of being dicked around with, and then only later coming to find that the depths of douchebaggery are apparently limitless, I find myself writing this review encouraging anyone and everyone to stay as far away from this place as you possibly can, and know especially that if you deal with Tony, you will be ripped off, lied to, and treated with less care than the fecal matter on the bottom of his shoe.  It all started about 9 months ago now, when I decided that it was time for me to upgrade my current bass rig to my dream rig which included an Epifani UL2 4x10 cab. My current cab at the time had a blown speaker and sounded terrible. Epifani is a very small company and had only one dealer in Tucson: Sticks n strings. So I went down there to see what they had, and there wasn't much. A single performance series (Epifani's lowest end line) 4x10 cab marked down to $650. I played through it and was not very impressed. I was quite familiar with the line and knew that I wanted something from their top line.  I began speaking to Tony, he said that he could order it, and that he would give me a really good deal on it because he knew me and my store (he quoted me at about $1000). He told me it would take between 2 and 4 weeks to arrive. I asked him if I could make a down payment of $200 to get the ball rolling. He said that would be fine. I handed him the cash, he shook my hand with a smile, told me he'd order it that day, and I left the store with a grin on my face that I very soon was going to have the first piece of my dream rig!  Over the next few weeks, I kept feeding Tony more and more money and he began to tell me about strange things going on with Epifani. You see, they were fresh out of UL2s in their warehouse, so they were having to build one for me...was going to take an extra week or two. You see, they're coming out with their new line of UL3s, and they're really trying to fill those orders right now...may take an extra couple weeks.   Literally 3 months go by. Tony has $900 of my money, and I don't have a cab. I'm extremely distrustful of Tony at this point, but stupidly am still believing that the problem is still at least somewhat on Epifani's side.   Finally, Tony tells me that he spoke to the people that morning and that the cab has been shipped and its on its way! HOORAY!!! I ask him to get me a tracking number, he never does. He tells me it should be in by the end of the week. I figure, even if he's been lying to me this whole time, the cab has to be here in a week, right? He can't stall any more...if the cab isnt here, the jig is up and Ill know 100% without a doubt that Tony is the problem, and Ill raise hell. So I feel comfortable enough with the situation to sell my previous cab (now leaving me without an amp to play on) in preparation for my new cab arriving in a week.  Sure enough, come end of the week, guess what!?!? The cab was delivered COD, and Tony claims to have paid them up front for it. He tells me he had to send it back to the factory to have them re-ship it NOT COD. As a store owner, I know that this is horseshit. If there is a problem with a COD, the company can correct that with UPS and the package can be redelivered the next day. However, he tells me its already gone back and now im pissed. I have waited for MONTHS, and now its going to be another 2 weeks or some shit and I don't even have a cab?!?! WHAT THE FUCK?!?  Tony tells me that he knows, its all fucked up...Epifanis a bunch of shit heads...but he maybe has a solution for the time being: he'll let me borrow the performance series cab while Im waiting on my UL2 to come in for the next two weeks, so at least ill have something to play through. I say fine, but 2 weeks and thats the end of this nonsense.   2 weeks go by...then 3...then 4...at which point I called him and told him that I either wanted all my money back or Id take the performance cab for 300, and I wanted the rest back. He agreed to sell me the cab. After trying to dick me AGAIN on getting my money back, I got the assistant manager to write me a check for what he owed me while Tony was out on lunch, and I left pissed off, but at least with a working cab.   Until just last month a speaker blew on the performance. Not wanting to deal with Sticks N Strings, I contact Epifani directly and speak to the owner, who tells me that they dont deal with SnS anymore because they had lots of problems, and that over a YEAR ago, Tony was trying to get the speakers on my performance replaced. In other words, TONY KNEW HE SOLD ME A BAD CAB! What a fucking asshole!!!  So, NEVER EVER AGAIN will I shop here. Absolutely deplorable and I will be contacting the BBB as well. What a shit stain on the Tucson community.”

- “Avoid this Shell location. Prices are higher than almost any other Shell in the Tucson area other than the one at Rita Rd and I-10.”
- “Never again!  Extremely expensive, reeks of Marijuana from the "medical" dispensary in the same building,  and a bunch of pot heads hanging around in the store and in the parking lot. Some were obviously high and then got into cars and drove away stoned. Absolutely disgusting. I'm so glad I didn't have my kids with me. If I could rate it a zero or less, I would.”

- “I love Popeyes chicken.  I often frequent their other location on Campbell and haven't been disappointed.  However, the one on Stone is a disaster.  My mom and I went through the drive through and ordered a 12 piece chicken only box.  We received our order super fast... too fast.  When we got home, the chicken super dry and old. I called the manager and he was snotty saying they changed out their chicken every 30 minutes. This was NOT true in this case. I won't be back.”
- “Service was horrible from the beginning, my order was wrong, chicken tenders were TOO well done and burnt, you cannot even pull it apart, the Mac and cheese tasted like chemicals and my entire order was rushed, barely waited in like for food that was already pre cooked and disgusting! DO NOT RECOMMEND”
- “I went here, to attempt to get their new chicken sandwich. They were completely out of them so I had to get something else. It took quite a long time in the drive thru, the girl at the window was pretty rude. My food wasn't great, was cold, and they didn't even put in the bag the items listed on the receipt. Won't be back. Supremely disappointed”

- “I called the nurse and she told me to take the medication that I was given which was three different kinds at the same time even when I was ovulating. When I finally got to speak with the doctor he told me "no I was only supposed to  take the Clomid" so that ruined my first cycle And these medications are not cheap with no insurance.                                                                 My second cycle success!! but sadly  it up an ectopic pregnancy 7 1/2 weeks. Regardless we still went back to him this year. 2017  We trust him, we like him, and he just gives off that vibe that he really cares                                      However, I feel that SOME of his nursing staff and some of his receptionist need to step up their personal relation skills just a little bit more and be more in sync with the doctor. In my opinion if not under constant guidance they think they know the answers that we need to ask the doctor specifically. One receptionist was really rude to My Husband and didn't want to schedule an appointment before my cycle started which was in just a few days. She would've had me scheduled after my cycle day three, so therefore I would not of been able to take my Clomid that month. The second receptionist that we spoke to said "come on in and if you're a little bit late that's fine." Seeing as how all we needed was a refill.   We had one but waited a year before going back to Gelety so the pharmacy said " sorry, it's been to long you have to see the doctor."  We were just getting the prescription refill. Gelety came in and when I explain the situation he was very nice polite said" no problem"  ‍ Wrote me the prescription for Clomid and told me to come back in a couple weeks due to the risk of the ectopic pregnancy.   I HIGHLY recommend this man to any man & woman or couple that are trying to conceive a baby. He will not stop till you get that baby, that's attitude I got from him. I've had two boys 16 & 12. So he checked my husbands sperm count & mobility and said " I can't express enough how high of a count you have and great mobility- he was just as excited as we were!!! Because I have no female problems he thinks clomid is the way to go. We trust him. Just wish the ultra sound cost could be lowered for those paying cash on a sliding scale income. That would be generous & selfless of him. .  The Walkers  Doctors experience: Gelety really cares. I genuinely believe that he wants to help people that are have infertility problems, that he's not in it just for the money..                     I hope in the future that he considers help with those that have no insurance and are paying cash that he would please possibly do a sliding scale fee on Ultra Sounds( basic check ups)   ‍ He is noninvasive, easy to get along with, gets excited for you, shows compassion when you you're upset.    Your first appoint be ready to anwser a lot of questions. WRITE THESE ANSWERS down and take them in with you to be prepared FOR HIS QUESTIONS .  *Know your cycles & right them down. *Date of last menstrual flow. *How long have you been trying under 40 ( a year or two with no success he'll help) Over 40 if in 6 months no success go see him)  *Write down how many days between each menstrual flow. *After your period ends but before it begins is your luthal phase, write down how many days that is. Because he *NEEDS* this info & no sense in waisting time on your consult. Come prepared.  *How many pregnancies? *How many live births? *Ages? *Any miscarriages, abortions or ectopics? He don't judge. *Coffee ( how much?)  *Alcohol,( how much?)  *Smoking ( how much) *Drugs ( what kind?)  *Any family history you feel may be important and if you've ever been diagnosed with endometriosis? *A medical background of ovarian cyst? The more you write down and take with you to see him with you the quicker the consultation and the better he can help you! With your accurate honest notes, just don't forget to bring them in lol”
- “Dr. Gelety and his team are amazing! They were upfront about what my options were, there were no hidden costs, they were fast yet efficient. If it weren't for them I would never have my two beautiful babies that I do have. They were always understanding and caring. I honestly don't have one bad thing to say about this clinic!”

- “I am writing this review with a very heavy heart. I really wish I was giving AZ Center for Reproductive Endocrinology & Infertility 5/5 stars, but unfortunately, since they have forever changed my life for the worst I cannot. My fiance and I went to AZCREI February 2014. At the time, I had just discovered that I had Endometriosis. We wanted to see if anything else would effect our fertility so for a few weeks we went back and fourth from Mesa to Tucson. They ran a few tests on me and my fiance. Ultimately we discovered that my fiance's sperm count was "a little low" but it shouldn't effect our chances. I got off of birth control and we started trying. As soon as I got off of the birth control, the Endometriosis cause me lots of pain. We kept trying for months and months all while i was in debilitating pain. Finally when I couldn't handle it anymore I had excision surgery for Endometriosis. I was so confident that right after this surgery we would get pregnant. After surgery my surgeon told me that my fallopian tubes were clear and we should try conceiving again because we had the best chance at that time.  We tried and tried again. No pregnancy. Finally I began to be in pain again so I got back on birth control to suppress the Endometriosis. I called AZCREI to get my records so we could bring them to another doctor to look over. I had to call multiple times to get them mailed to me because they had been placed in the 'wrong place' a few times. When I finally received my records I was shocked. Without going into too much detail, we wouldn't have been able to conceive on our own. We have had two other fertility doctors look over our records and they both have said the same thing. With the lack of information this may have completely ruined our chances of ever conceiving. If we had know this information originally we would have been able to try IVF, i wouldnt be suffering as much and surgery could have been put off for a little while longer...but now we have more factors in our way. AZCREI has ruined the biggest dream that we have ever had and has set us so far back that we may never get another chance at this. Please do not go to AZCREI! Its not worth the hundreds of tears and broken dreams.  PS: their office had called me tonight asking when I would be there to pick up my records.........I received them about a month ago. This place needs to be more organized, but that is the least of their problems.”
- “Review of Fertility Clinic  Avoid this place.  As if the fertility process isn't difficult enough, Martha Silva makes the process 10 times more difficult and stressful than necessary AND gives inaccurate medical information.  Her condescending manner is intended to mask her incompetence and idiocy. While I don't doubt Dr. Gelety is a good doctor, most dealings will be with Martha.   Also, the place is completely disorganized and you will have to deal with Martha Silva, who doesn't know what she's doing and has no ability to differentiate between what is material vs. immaterial information.  This is a long review, but this is an important issue.  There are so many better and kinder/gentler fertility clinics in Tucson, so don't waste your time here.  I come from a family of physicians, and I can tell you for certain that they are operating like a poorly run auto mechanic's shop.  Rude, ignorant and, accordingly, dangerous.  I asked on multiple occasions to speak with Dr. Gelety and not Martha, and to whom does the receptionist transfer me to?  Martha.  First, I had made appointments with the front desk for a specific procedure and called back to ensure that the clinic would be ready and that I was getting the correct appointment.  They assured me that I was confirmed; however, upon arrival, they completely dropped the ball and my donor and I ended up having to spend over 3 hours there because they realized that they weren't prepared for the procedures I'd said we needed.  I also don't understand why they couldn't have checked my file to see what the next steps were.    Second, my donor had lab tests completed and they never called or sent me a letter to tell me the results of the tests.  I called back twice and no one ever called me back.  Finally, after calling back a third time, Martha Silva calls me back and acts as if she has no idea why she's calling me.  I tell her I want the lab results of an STD screening.  She tells me my donor had tested positive for one of the screenings, and when I ask her about it, she basically has no idea what it is.  I'm not joking when I say her explanation was "Women get it when they're exposed to wild cats." My donor is a male--so what relevance does exposure by women to cats have to do with my situation?  I realize I'm getting nowhere after she fumbles for another minute, so I ask, more specifically, "Does it affect the sample or have any adverse effects on getting pregnant or having a healthy child?"  She says, as if I were to know this, "Oh no no no.  This has no effect. It is just something he was exposed to at some point, but it isn't active."  I asked her whether it could become active and what happens when it is active, and her response (again, no joke) was "Well, I know when it's active people get really, really, really sick." WOW.  This, coming from a purported medical professional.   Well, after transferring to another fertility clinic, I was told more about the disease screening and learned that actually the inactive status could increase chances of the child having the disease AND it is HARMFUL to children and sometimes deadly.  WOW.  Not only did she prioritize information about wild cats and getting "Really really sick", but she incorrectly informed me that the exposure was completely harmless.  I questioned her response, since if the disease is tested for in this process, wouldn't it be something that could potentially be harmful--otherwise, why require it as a test?  Finally, there were several questions on the donor questionnaire that my donor refused to complete, because they are completely irrelevant (for example, what are your hobbies?  When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?).  I called the clinic asking whether those questions needed to be completed, and Martha Silva said EVERY question needed to be completed because the FDA checks the questionnaire.  Really--the FDA cares what my donor's hobbies are?  I spoke with Dr. Gelety, who told me I could skip those questions.  But later, when I spoke with Martha Silva, she condescendingly told me that she was going to go through each page of the questionnaire to make sure we'd completed it thoroughly and if there were unanswered questions they couldn't proceed with next steps.  Basically, she was being vindictive because she somehow thought that I was undermining her authority.   This is a woman who should NOT be in the medical profession, since "do no harm" is not a Hippocratic oath that she has apparently taken.  What Martha Silva fails to realize is that she is NOT a doctor and she's far from the smartest person in the room.”
- “Did I mention that this is a reproductive facility?!? A place women go when they already feel defeated.  I didn't proceed with my appointment & I would be lying if I said I walked out. I was forced to leave as I was extremely upset with how the doctor acted & his nurses. Despite the ability to not agree, he was rude, cowardly & is not someone I would trust and I will make sure every women is warned.  He might be one of the few fertility doctors in the area But you have options. Don't be so quick to support a doctor that wont support you.”

- “What a great business ! From meeting MaryBeth to Jason our project manager, there kindness and care that they took with us was outstanding.  The team that showed up to do our roof were professional and we could tell they knew what they were doing.  We highly recommend them.”
- “Really, probably a 4.5 stars, but rounding up is the best idea, and I would recommend their work.  I had an assessment following storm damage I sat on longer than was reasonable. The assessor laid out the process, options, and upgrades available in a way I found to be very low pressure.  Jason was the project manager I worked with, and he did a great job on keeping me updated with the timetable and process, even being so good as to stop by my office rather than having me come home on my lunch hour to collect payment for the extras I agreed to.  The actual roof went on very quickly. My only issues was that the roofing crew did crush one of the plants and I've had to fish a couple sheets of shingles out of the pool, which I was warned about. The painters also had a scheduling issue, but that was resolved without issue.  Overall, I'm very pleased with Fallers and would gladly work with them again!”

- “The owner Michael is a liar. He's a smart ass. Dose not stand by his word. They hire day labor. They refer  painters without contractor license.   Fallers Restoration Michael will not stand by his referral.    My house looks like crap. It's my loss for not checking out the painter he told me.  I should have checked out Michael and his company. Fallers Restoration...  gain your confidence make you feel you can trust them. Not true!   Funny after a few months, I decide to complain again. Jason's his assistance comes and takes a bunch of pictures leaves.   I get a call, Jason wants to come out to interduce me to a new painter. To my surprise I was told the whole house was going to get painted, We even set a day to get the job done.    I get a call from the smart ass Michael telling me that's not happening. I need to go after the painter. Even had the nerve to lecture me on what I done wrong why this happened to me.   I called the painter, disconnected his phone. Fallers Restoration Michael knew that.   So now I have to come up with another $2,500 to have my house repainted.    Another thing I cannot get Fallers Restoration to come fix a corner that keeps popping up. I had to put a weight on it. Looks nice Michael! Real professional job...   Another note they do not have a physical address they use at PO box at a UPS Store something to consider. In fact there physical address is actually a bed store.”
- “I don't know much about this company, a few of my neighbors have used them, so they've been leaving fliers on my door for months.  They've probably left at least 6.  If I had wanted to call, I would have.  I went with another company and had my roof replaced a week ago.  Guess who rang my bell, and then left ANOTHER flier today?  If you can't see that the roof is brand new, then you are not really qualified to represent a roofing company.”
- “I was happy with the main project Michael, although, not so much now.  You did not fix a corner on my roof which keeps popping up. I use a weight to keep it down and this was reported during the walk through of the completion of said roof with Jason your boy.  He was reminded many times and it was even mention to you. Looks real professional Michael.  To this day I have fascia not even scraped of old paint and repainted. If I could post pic I would.   Fallers Restoration states I found my own painter. That's a lie! Jason their boy fell all over himself telling me how wonderful their House Painter was. I used their painter because he was the man Fallers Restoration was paying to paint my fascia from the roofing job. Jason recommended him highly, good enough for them, good enough for me because of the work to that point on the roof only!!!   Fallers Restoration has been cleaning up their painters messes all over my community every since. I got the worst of this painter. Maybe the problem was the day labors their painter was using and lack of supervision on Fallers Restorations part. I was told Fallers Restoration fired their painter after my house.  No way of contacting their painter now. Michal said that's my problem...   My house is not getting repainted anytime soon. If anyone would like to stop by take a look contact me, 520-975-0597  I'll be glad to show you around.   Fallers even informed me my warranty is voided on my roof for posting a review of my experience with them. Frankly I don't give a damn.  All the more reason I need to do this review. Fallers Restoration will also be reported to the BBB.. That's going to be next Michael  I wonder why you sent your boy out to take picture after talking with you Michael ?  A week later you sent your boy out with a painter telling me your going to paint my entire house? Again your painter! A few hours later you called telling me that's not going to happen !   My posting is to warn consumers of my experience with your company and the unprofessional way Michael, the owner of the company treats the customer.  He is both disrespectful and confrontational.   If this review cost Fallers a customer or two, their choice! I would worry about how many. Its a review! My right! My experience.  I'm the one out the cost of a new paint job on my house. Fallers does not give a damn.... My advice find another company.”

Imagine our surprise when almost a year later, we are contacted by a collection agency for ~$1,000 in charges Palm Shadows never billed for or explained despite having my complete contact information.  I have to question the kind of business that turns you over to a collection agency before even presenting you with a bill or calling you, and that too nine months later.  It makes for a very stressful situation.   The renters are almost exclusively young, not necessarily experienced students who don't remember, or didn't pay attention to all of the contractual requirements, so please be aware that you will need to provide at least 30 days notice that you will not be renewing your lease, or a year later you will be contacted by a collection agency for one month's extra rent plus...”
- “This is a bad place to live in. Besides it looks like a motel, the people from the office don't care about the issues your place may have. My experience was bad there was several things that weren't working like the stove, the air conditioning. My first month I had to pay 600 dollars of electricity because the A/C wasn't working well and still isn't. I would put work order so they can see the A/C because it wasn't cooling down and I would set it to 75 and the temperature would be 85. Throughout the months I would keep putting a work order to at least see it and all they did was change the filter of the A/C. We don't have A/C neither heather. It was a struggle and really uncomfortable. And with the 600 electricity bill they said it was my fault for putting the the A/C on 70 which is ridiculous. I highly don't recommend people to come live here.”

The portions are big and you will definitely have enough to share!The cheese was a little salty for my taste. They are usually fast and give out free samples. The employees are nice and make sure to have food ready for you so you don't have to wait too long for it. They also have frozen drinks and lemonade. I mixed the strawberry lemonade and blueberry, it was amazing! This place is in the mall so it's something quick you can get while shopping.”

- “Went in for just some Pretzel bites and a small lemonade. Menu was confusing with just a bunch of colorful pictures of food with no prices on them. The cashier worked me like a car salesman telling me she could get me two orders of Pretzel bites with an extremely large "fresh" strawberry lemonade for $4.00 and at the last minute tried to charge me $15.00. Ended up getting the one to split with my girlfriend with the fresh strawberry lemonade that is actually just lemonade with a couple squirts of disgusting syrup. The pretzels were extremely salty and the lemonade was way too sweet due to the syrup and ultimately made my girlfriend sick. Definitely not worth the eleven bucks when I could get basically the same thing at QT for a lot cheaper and would even taste better than the crap Wetzel's tries to pass off as food.”
- “Terrible sorry half cooked pretzel - stick to pretzel maker in main food court. Service was bad - price too high and product was awful. Would be sent to firing squad if they tried to serve that $hi7 in Germany.”
- “Absolutely Shittiest customer service ever, i work at the mall and used to frequent here allot, they have a punch card mall employees can buy that gets you a fountain drink with each punch, after all punches are punched you redeem the card for a pretzel. I tried to redeem my card today and in the rudest way possible the lady behind the register told me thats not how it works and your given the pretzel when you purchase the card...... Even though ive been explained the opposite multiple times, NEVER BEEN GIVEN A PRETZEL AT TIME OF CARD PURCHASE, and DONE THE OPPOSITE multiple times reedeming the card for a pretzel.... Oh well wont be getting another drink card or anything else from them for that matter. Do yourself a favor and head to the other end of the mall and get Pretzel Maker instead, much better pretzels and way better customer service”

These people are the worst, rude, never fix anything and basically couldn't care less about their tenants! 2 people here had covid n they still wouldn't come n sanitize the common areas or gates or anything for that matter! Our pool has been closed for months even though all the appts in our area  opened theirs a month ago! Excuses included: we have no one to sanitize after use, we don't have the funds for sanitation ( they have spent no $ on this building all year?) We don't want to get sued, etc. On the other hand they allow a Tennant to air b n b since march ( against CDC rules) and continue to do so. Wont even consider any security even though numerous people have been robbed ( including myself), over 30 cars have been broken in to and we have homeless tweekers roaming around the building on a daily basis?

- “Do not use this real estate company. They use corrupt agents. We called Jennifer Tillman and told her we wanted to put in an offer on a condo she had listed. It was late at night. She said great, and I emailed her our offer at that time, and asked her to write up the contract. She said she would do so the next day, but instead of writing up the contract, she texted and said she took our offer verbally to the seller, and the seller accepted our offer (we offered $3000 less than list price). Jennifer said she would write up the contract the following day. My husband and I did not like that she was stalling on writing up the offer, but we trusted her, and figured if the seller agreed to our offer, integrity would prevail. But, the next day, late in the afternoon, after waiting all day to receive the contract in our email box, Jennifer called and told me she received a higher offer, and that she had an obligation to show that to her seller. According to her, she had not even contacted the seller before calling us. I know if it were me, and she were my agent, I would not be happy that she was talking to that buyer about another offer coming in instead of talking to me first about the situation. Because we knew Jennifer was playing us against this other offer, and no longer trustworthy, my husband and I backed out, unwilling to pay more or work with such a person. Her actions were dishonest, unethical, and unprofessional. If she or the seller still wanted to consider other offers, Jennifer should never have told us our offer was accepted, or told us she was writing up the contract. She should have told us that they were still considering other offers. Jennifer Tillman's style of work is extremely bad business ethics. This agent is not to be trusted, and neither is the company that hires her, because they condone such practices.”
- “Oh if they ever let us give them a negative star! My recommendation... don't come here! And for those of you thinking  using them to have them the out your space. Don't do it. I was a tenant and rented a condo... the carpet was disgusting. Drain didn't drain. Walls had crayon marks everywhere. Not really what you want to walk in to. Imagine if you were the owner! They "hired" someone to look at the place and have them say that it was okay to let someone rent it . I guess the real reason for this review is because of the end of my lease I had emailed our agent maybe about 5 or 6 times to let them know that I wasn't going to be renewing my lease. After finally getting the agent to acknowledge me, I left at the end of the month as promised oh and the whole process was RIDICULOUS I left on a Sunday and when I texted the agent if i could mail him the keys as I was moving out of town he said the keys would need to be turned in my midnight. I asked him if there was a drop box. Tried to reach him multiple time but no answer. But since I didn't want to be charged a stupid ridiculous price I had to drive 30 min east WITH my moving truck around 7 pm... THERE IS NO DROP BOX  I ended up mailing it to him. THEN asked him for my refundable security deposit of course no response. Emailed I guess the "owners" of copper rose, no response from them either. After TWO months of trying he then tells me that I broke my lease a month early and therefore I could not get my deposit. Checking all my paperwork he is right but here is why I am mad he didn't have the COURTESY to tell me that I was "breaking" my lease therefore I wouldn't get my $700 deposit back.. he ASSUMED that I knew all of that.... ugh I have moved on and had to block his email and their company email because I keep getting a notice that my rent is late. It's July I moved out in March. I really hope y'all stay away from this company because they really do suck. So much.”

- “Love this store. I used to visit here for all non-food items and the Neighborhood market on 22nd/craycroft for food but now I shop for it all here since I watched it become the supercenter:) Ad matching should put other stores out of business. I only wish they weren't so picky about the exact cuts or packages of meat/size/fresh cut.”
- “If you are in this area this location will serve all your needs for a neighborhood grocery store.  Employees are nice too!”
- “This store is awesome.  Back in March from here in Florida I went online to this particular store in Tucson on Speedway Blvd and ordered a 20 inch bicycle my Great Grand-daughter picked out for her birthday.  I ordered it around 6:30 AM or there about and it was delivered to their house in Tucson around 10:30 Am the same day.  No later than 4 hours after I ordered, I was so grateful and surprised as I thought it would be delivered a week later. My granddaughter was surprised as was the all her family. We all were pleasantly surprised . She was thrilled to get this beautiful bicycle and already assembled a week early before her birthday. Thank you Walmart. You made, not only the birthday girl happy & surprised but her entire family.”

- “Not sure how to address such a huge display of rudeness and incompetence.  A simple return was turned into a 30 minute ordeal.  Not only was I misinformed about the return, I was told there was nothing she could do. I asked why. "What do you want from me? I make minimum wage." Never go there. Management was no help”
- “Walmart does not care about their employees while i see them in the hot sun for 110 degrees outside for hours not even checking up on them, providing cold water and ice packs. Does anyone else notice how bad that is? if chick fil a can keep their employees happy why can't walmart wtf.”
- “I just called to get a price for (4) tires for my car.  The girl who answered the phone said, "Yeah, we can't do that for you today.  There's only one guy out there and he's already working on another car."  I said, "I don't expect him to do it today; I'm looking for a price on what it will cost me."  She said, "Yeah, we wouldn't be able to do that today."  So, you're telling me that because the mechanic is out in the garage, you can't look up a price in the book??”

## Tips from customers
People of Walmart. It never gets old! I'm in hell Pretty good mark downs right now This is the worse Walmart I have seen in a long time! First of all it was not organized and the food shelves were almost emptyThe cashier was unfriendly.  It didn't meet the Walmart 's mission.  Smiling face wasnt real!  I wouldn't come back to this one. The Walmart on crofton road is so much better Super duper busy!! Bumper-carts wall-to-wall. Bring your patience. You'll need it at this store! This is the most mess Walmart I ever seen in Tucson! Everything is  not organized! The floor was dirty! Walmart is one of the worst places to get tires. They are under staffed for their volume. It takes FOREVER to get the work done. (Almost 3 hours for a flat repair as I write this.) Go to Discount Tire. They are fast. Great prices and great service. Price gouging they charge $20 more for the same product as they do at the other walmart stores.  Was told they charge different depending on neighborhood. Per management " if we can get 20 dollars more for the same thing in this neighborhood we will".  Store filthy. And nothing special. Never returning Stopped here since my Wally World was out of a product. Perfect place for a drive-by, mugging or to catch a disease only found in a 3rd World country. They actually wax over the nasty floors.  Never seen so many open packs of underoos in a single store.  Thankfully my cashier, Linda, was sweet. I have yet to locate the baphomet I'm convinced is in here somewhere... Not exactly the nicest walmart I have seen....pretty. dirty as a matter of fact. Employees not helpful at all...pretty sad when the cox cable rep in store gives better customer service! (Without even trying to sell me any services!) But convienent location... what do you expect? It is Walmart after all..... Sunday before Xmas is so awesome. Mid-day is not the ideal time to shop here Always spend more then expected Possibly the worst customer service I have ever experienced This place never answers the phone phones been ringing for 45 minutes now quality people got my wife beater on Literally the worst Walmart ever

- “I want to give huge praise to the crew that worked last night,  when we arrived around 7pm it was packed, a very long line. We waited maybe 15 min. But watching how they worked thier butt off was fascinating. We sat down and ate our food continue to watch them helping customers.  I wanted to clap and tell them all they were Amazing!! I will definitely come back.”
- “Recently did an online order for LOTS of food and they completed the order perfectly. I got everything I ordered and it was ready very quickly. I was able to walk in, give them my name, and they handed me my food.  All staff are wearing masks and gloves. None of the tables are open for seating and there are signs to reinforce social distancing. There was only 2 other customers inside so it definitely wasn't crowded. Food was delicious, very satisfied with this location.”

- “Very bad experience, in the past have given this store 4 stars   I know things are bad and things are done differently but my shrimp and noodles were burnt. So gross. I would be a little more understanding but..... i paid 14 bucks for food I could not eat. And I'm on Broadway and Prudence so I could not just run back. This not cool. I can't believe they even served it to me. Poor quality, poor customer service. Super sad. I love this place normally. Can't go back, this the 2 nd time it's been awful .one unhappy person”
- “If I could give zero stars I would   The customer service was horrible  the one girl was extremely rude    We do frequent this location often and hasn't ever been overly present but the food is good after todays experience I will never return to this location     I will happily drive to the tanque verde and sabino canyon location  even though I am only about 2 min from this location.   They did have a bunch of mobile orders and I said I'd wait no rush what so ever as I wasn't on a time crunch for me to be anywhere so I stepped off to the side to wait   They served 2 other walk in's before me.   Again not a problem with that. They were clearly in more of a hurry than I was so I got back in line and she basically yelled at me and very snarky face to be step aside there's others here to be served first.   Again so disappointed and would give zero stars if possible will never return”
- “I pointed out that a gentleman behind the counter was not wearing gloves and he was putting his bare fingers inside peoples boxes while scooping food in and he continued to do so after I asked him not to. We're in the middle of a pandemic! Why are you not wearing gloves when touching peoples food???”

## Tips from customers
Thank you for the food poisoning! Never coming to this location again. My first time at Panda Express. Not bad. I enjoyed the orange chicken very much. Fried rice is ok.  Liked the Honey walnut shrimp Expect to be in the drive thru for 15-20 minutes.... We both like this PE better than most.  Good food....ample servings (should have taken half home for dinner.  Modest prices.  Clean.

- “Very modern, clean building hosting the Tucson Roadrunners and a variety of shows . I am very happy to go to any event in this building. Plus every time I have had to encounter any staff/security, they have all been helpful and friendly. As for people stating the seats are too small, I would agree that there is not a lot of leg room, but the chairs are comfortable and not too narrow. I am not even the skinniest girl in the world so I really cannot see why too many people are complaining. The venue is easy to navigate and clean and great for Tucson!”
- “Attended the Mineral show at this Arena.  The show is amazing.  It is an annual show that takes over Tucson for the month of February.  Amazing specimens of minerals collected from all over the world.  Many international guests with the mineral or rockhound bug attend the show.  In addition there are many in the gem trade.  If you are a fan of chemistry or simply enjoy beautiful rocks and minerals you will be absolutely blown away by this show.  The Tucson Arena is the heart of the show - thousands of vendors inside and out in surrounding tent cities.”

- “This venue is incredibly unorganized. We arrived 30 minutes before our event and sat in traffic in line to get into the parking lot for the full 30 minutes and then when we got to the entrance we were told the lot is full and to go to the garage on Broadway/Church. We drove to the Broadway/Church garage as instructed and were told it was also full. We ended up paying for parking downtown and walking to the venue. There should have been communication ahead of time to let patrons know there wasn't enough parking for the number of tickets sold. If we had known that we would have gone straight to one of the downtown garages and parked there and walked instead of waiting in line for the arena parking lot only to get turned away. We missed the first 40 minutes of an event we paid for because they were so unorganized.”
- “Saw Simone Biles and the GOAT tour here. The facility turned back literally hundreds of women, my wife included, because they didn't allow purses. This being downtown, we had to walk 1/2 mile back to our parking spot to leave her purse. The purse policy was not disseminated ahead of time.  Once inside, the chairs are uncomfortable and the refreshments outrageous even by stadium pricing.”
- “This one star review is entirely for the sardine feel of the seats. Unbelievably narrow seats and no legroom whatsoever. I am 5'5 and my knees touched the seat in front of me, not only is this very uncomfortable, but it also means that you have to stand up every single time someone walks down your row. This is disruptive when it happens repeatedly, both as a person having to stand and also as a person whose view is blocked every time someone else has to stand. I also felt like I bruised my legs on the cup holders- unreal and very cheap feeling. I loved the performance we saw (Disney on ice) but that was the only redeeming quality of the Tucson arena. Also, there were thousands of children at this event, and no diaper changing stations in the bathroom. I had to change my daughter as she stood in the bathroom stall with me, and I saw another woman who laid her daughter in the floor of the bathroom to change her. Get it together Tucson arena! It will take a lot to get us to go back!”

Ordered TOASTED with cream cheese!!! Honestly would almost not have minded a wait time-if-two bagels were not just thrown in a bag. Also, no napkins for my cream cheese and raw bagels. UGH GET IT TOGETHER!!”
- “not to be a karen, but very inconsistent all the time on the way they put cream cheese on thing and EVERYTIME I ask for this thing toasted, it comes out as if they hadn't toasted it at all.:( this has happened to me 3 diffent times. ya girl just wants a crunchy bagel in the morning”

## Tips from customers
They don't take coupons for anything, and no parking. Was very disappointed . Quick service considering the line length, delicious bagels always. Bless their hearts, Einstein's can't toast a bagel.

- “Well after a year and a half of service we are still very satisfied with Titan.  I did get my complementary bins last year. New.  They leave no debrie behind after a pick up if it  Falls out from something.  The have more narrow trucks than standard and have no trouble in our  cul de sacs.  I think we are lucky we have them. The big green alternative would never fit around here.”

- “NON-EXISTENT CUSTOMER SERVICE This trash pick up service is our only option where we live, so I guess not having any competitors makes this company so confident that they DON'T CARE IF THEY HAVE UNHAPPY CUSTOMERS. I want to set Auto Pay on their website and I can't do it because they ask for an "ID number" aside from the account number, this number is supposed to appear on my invoice but there is nowhere to be found. She, Amanda the manager, has already charged me a late fee because I didn't pay on time the last bill which I didn't get in the mail or through my email account.  I have left multiple messages on their office number, send her text messages, send her emails through the webpage and NO ANSWER WHATSOEVER!!!!”
- “HORRIBLE customer service by Amanda Crawford Maestas.  I have been trying to schedule a bulk pick-up for what seems over 2 weeks.  She is very passive aggressive by not answering her phone or emails in a timely manner.  She did try to call me back once when I was driving and the call said PRIVATE NUMBER, I don't know about you, but I do not answer Private Number calls because they are undoubtedly bad calls. There is no way to get a hold of anyone else to actually solve problems. Amanda would have much less work to do if she actually took care of requests immediately instead of stringing people on days for days, that takes a lot more time and energy.  She actually just called me again after I told the actual route Driver today that she was awful, she hung up on me as I was telling her that she is inefficient in customer service and solving problems.  This is the type of customer service that she provides.  The Owner of Titan Trash needs to get rid of this obstructionist and get someone in that job that can actually do the job and treat customers like customers.  She is AWFUL.  She actually told me that she often works from home.  Perhaps that is the problem.  Perhaps she isn't really working?  If she's working from home then she should have a company cell phone that will show the number when she is calling customers.  This is just the worst of excuse of customer service I have seen in a very long time.  The guys on the truck are excellent.”

- “I can't believe the negative reviews about this post office! I ship packages fairly regularly and I would actually go so far as to describe my experiences there as "delightful". Having moved from DC to Tucson, I know what a horrific post office experience is like. I've only waited a few minutes here (as opposed to up to an hour in DC).  Also the employees are legitimately friendly. Y'all don't know how good we have it here!”
- “In a hurry to mail packages during my lunch time.  Received courteous, professional help and advice to save me time and money, (At the self serve kiosk). It was like having my own personal concierge.  When I complimented Elvia in making my day, she gave credit to the team. It has been my experience that all clerks there have always been the best folks to work with. They do go above and beyond!  Thank you, what you do is appreciated..”
- “I had been to the sun station many times but today I was fairly impressed in particular about the service i received. It would take a lot to get me to write a review about anything especially a post office, but the customer service here is phenomenal. The lady helping me, Elvia I believe, went to extremes to ensure that my package was shipped via the most economical means. I ended up paying half for shipping than I otherwise would. As a college student with a budget this was very important. I do agree with all the other commenters that the lines here are long, but the service made it worth the wait.”

- “I moved the last week of January, took in my lease and filled out a change of address form. They told my up to 10 days for my new mail key and they would hold my mail. I went in twice a week and each time was told I had to initiate the process all over again. They lost all my mail. My Amazon package shows delivered last Tuesday, but they cannot find it. Finally yesterday I got 3 mail keys. I try a key and it did not work on the lock. Lucky for me the second key worked. No mail. No package. I told the manager this was the most incompetent business I have ever dealt with. I have the tracking number from USPS and it shows delivered days before the key was made. I had to get very demanding last week to get this key made. The head supervisor blamed mail theft and claimed my box was broken into. But my mail was to be held on the break in days. I have spoken to 3 supervisors and are absolutely disorganized and not qualified.”
- “I had to purchase a stamp and mail a letter but the signage at this location is terrible. I could not find the customer entrance (if there even is one). I ended up having to go to another Post Office location where there was no parking lot. I would recommend avoiding the Post Office in Tucson in general. Buy your stamps elsewhere if possible.”
- “The postmaster at this location is incompetent.  They returned 2 cases of powdered laundry detergent to my armed forces contractor after shipping the same product for 5 years.  I took the 2 cases in question to the Sun Station post office to explain the matter.  The issue is that the powdered detergent is made by Clorox.  The post master at this location said that any box that sais "Clorox" will be considered bleach.  She called me a liar when I explained that I have been shipping the product for atleast 5 years thorough this station.  I have been told by the vendor "Clorox" that this is a mailable package via USPS.  They will not negotiate with me.  I left this station feeling belittled with 10 people behind me me thinking I was arguing for no reason.”

Manager super nice and helpful! Line is very long before closing. Come in during noon and it's dead! one postman is consistently grouchy.  I'll let you guess which one. Always a long wait

Kaelen, Nadia, Karen and the other staff are so supportive and want to help me in any way they can to achieve my goals. I wish I would have known how great the treaments are here before I was a student!! I used to pay 100's of dollars for sub par facials. The way this school teaches its students is to go above and beyond for exceptional service. For the $$ this is a tremendous value. Thanks to you guys for the best education possible and for giving the public a great place to address their skincare and relaxation needs for exceptional prices. You rock!”

- “If I could I would give this school a zero!They will Lie to you, tell you what you want to hear to suck you into their "Free Labor without pay program! Last time I checked that is illegal!They are not about the education aspect in line with proper standards and procedures with Arizona State Board.Instead they treat the school and the student has if it is a Day Spa! Its all about the CLIENTS! Stated by Kim, the Director of the school and Brook, PT Evening Instructor, What? did they forget that I am paying $14,000 for this school. Instructor is horrible, late, uncaring unorganized,unproductive, doesn't watch students while performing their procedures on one another has well as on clients in the (6) private treatment rooms. Since when did the instructor not have to oversee your procedures? Is that not what they get paid for. Not to mention what is required by them with Arizona State Baord! They allow Bullying, Disrespect and DRAMA! The instructor will undermine you in front of clients, your classmates and her coworkers. So will the director. They are two-faced, backstabbing, discreditable individuals. Performing massage therapy treatments without a license is illegal. There old location was called a School with a big open room with curtain dividers, the owner Kaleen Harwell is calling her new location on speedway in Tucson a School Salon! What the heck! I'm sorry but last time I checked to work In a salon you need to be licensed. Your full time, partime day and night students enrolled currently in your aesthics program are not licensed! Your receiving federal government funding, plus charging additional tuition. Your allowing students to perform LED TREATMENTS without any training on it? and other treatments. Your having students sign on to monthly agreements  to sell your retail product. She's running a salon, yet having students work on the clients without proper and adequate training or knowledge.Working in private treatment rooms seems against Arizona State Board of Cosmetology! Plus they will try to keep your money. Clients beware there back-bar, equipment and retail products are diluted and old and out of date. this place seems like their running a scam!”
- “So I can't speak for the actual clients that go in because I didn't go in for their services, just went in for a gift certificate. I walked up to the front desk but was very confused as to if that was where I needed to go because nobody was standing there. So I patiently waited. Next thing you know some lady starts yelling at a girl there! Clearly it was a student vs teacher showdown and there I am now looking for the popcorn to enjoy while I watch the show. Honestly I found it amusing but definitely not professional. I wasn't the only person who witnessed this, I noticed a few students who looked like scared abused children just waiting for their turn. At this point I still haven't even been greeted so I decided to leave before the estrogen bomb got any worse. I walked out and asked someone (who I determined was a student after conversation) what that was all about. She chuckled, rolled her eyes and said "Oh that's just Typical Kris, she obviously hasn't quenched her thirst for blood yet today". It was kind of funny. I had asked if she liked it there and she kind of shrugged her shoulders all while texting and gave me an "Eh, it's alright if you don't mind catching the corona virus. Hopefully you didn't touch anything in there." Ok WHAT?!?!?! I had to dig deeper. Maybe she was over exaggerating a bit but proceeded to tell me how the owner doesn't allow any kind of sanitizing chemicals because it isn't natural. Her preferred disinfecting method is vinegar. If this were to actually work I think we would see a shortage in vinegar at the stores rather than the absence of toilet paper. But who knows, maybe she's on to something. I tried to direct the conversation back to my original mission of why I was there and asked if she would be able to help me with a gift certificate or could recommend some product and comically she stated, "Would you drink expired milk?" I simply replied with a "No." and she left me with "Then why would you buy expired product?" There's so many things wrong with what I experienced while I was there! I'm not going to say I wouldn't recommend this place to people because maybe it was just a bad day where everyone was synced up to the same cycle. But WOW. Tell ya what though, if vinegar really kills Covid-19, I'm buying stock in that with the money I was going to use on a gift certificate!”
- “I looked into this school because the reviews I seen about it . I had a tour on Monday .   The lady had no idea what she was talking about I could not hear her she whispered the whole time while touring me  through the school. If your going to make your school  to be above other schools,some  good  advice  clean up remodel so any of the next future students who want to become a student at this school. I highly recommend not wasting your time you will be disappointed and some advice for the instructors our office management Make sure your class room is clean, it smells so weird in the class room it made my stomach turn. The floors look like they allowed students to spit gum on the cracked concrete floor it was so unappealing to see, the floors have big cracks in the cement floor, the laundry room was over loaded with laundry. When I first walked in the school it looks nice and clean once you get to the back it was different look.. Very unpleasant  to see. Over price products. The tour instructor needs more knowledge about touring the school. Long story short I changed my mind about attending this school. Not to mention they offered me some warm water with lemon it was very sour I never had an experience like this in my life. Future students know that this school will leave you with disappointments.                                                    From .Aka  ( long blonde hair ) .”

- “I waited a few months after my appointment before writing a review so that I could adequately comment on my end to end experience.  I had all of my windows replaced in October 2016.  The initial sales conversation lasted many hours, but he didn't waste my time.  He took a lot of pictures of my existing windows, inspected the existing windows inside and out.  He offered ideas for the best style of window use (for example, we replaced a bathroom window with one that uses obscure glass so we get the light in without needing a window covering).  He did talk prices and I felt that he showed the "regular price" vs. "special price".  This practice is no different with ANY business.  Walk into a Kohl's store and look at a shirt.  It will tell you the shirt is regularly $30, on sale for $12.99.  Same concept...make the price look like a deal. Here's the important part...I moved into a brand new house many years ago, and after about 8 years, the vinyl windows were warping/cracking.  The house I'm currently in is about 15 years old and those vinyl windows were falling apart.  Nowhere were there any warranties or promises from the home builder or window supplier that the windows would last, or that they would be replaced with normal weather issues.  Now consider Anderson...even if I break the damn window myself...they will come out and fix it.  Honestly, I had to make a decision...pay less for new vinyl windows now and have to replace them again when I'm in my 50's, or pay more now while I have a decent income and have peace of mind that I won't need to spend my retirement money on another set.  So I went with Anderson and their lender, Green Sky.  Yes, Green Sky immediately charged me, and I had to start paying even before the windows were installed.  I knew about this up front because my sales person told me what to expect.  You only have to pay the interest amount until the work is completed.  It was very clear that I had a short window in which to change my mind before the charges would be made, making it impossible to reverse.  Calm down, read what you sign, listen to what people tell you, and there will be no surprises.  Anderson came out as promised for the final measurement and the installation.  The installation took about two days (12 windows and a slider on a single story home).  The guys who came out were very young (which worried me at first), but they were professional, nice, and worked quickly.  They didn't waste any time and didn't bother me at all (I was working from home on the installation days). One of the screens was damaged in shipping.  Anderson ordered a replacement and they came out and installed it as soon as it arrived.  Quick and easy.   Now for the results:  My windows are AWESOME.  Two of my bedrooms get direct sunlight in the morning.  With the old windows, those rooms would be hot even during the winter.  No longer.  Standing next to the window, you feel the sunlight, but no other heat coming in from the outside.  My gas bill is about $20 less per month through this winter.  My electric bill was $50 less the first month I had the windows (and I only had them for a couple of weeks into the billing cycle.  During winter, the electric bill has averaged about $15 less per month.  I'll try to come back this summer and update any cost savings during the hot Tucson summer.  My favorite thing so far?  The dust...or lack thereof.  Before having my windows replaced by Anderson, I had to change my air filters every couple of months.  It's March. My current filters were put up on December 1.  I purchased new ones and went to remove the old filters and they were COMPLETELY CLEAN.  I'm talking...the filters that had been there for the coldest parts of the winter looked brand new!  No dust, nothing.  The only thing different in my world are my windows, so I'm giving the credit to Anderson for the dust reduction (and saving me the cost of replacing filters so often).  Here's a comment from my next door neighbor (who happens to be on the HOA board):  "Those new windows look like they came with the house.  You can't even tell that you had them replaced! They look great!"  If the HOA board member says that, it must be true.  My only issue:  When some of the caulking dried, it cracked a bit and I noticed that it lets in a little air.  Why this is MY issue and not Anderson's issue:  I haven't reported this to them (until now) because I just haven't had time and it's not that big of a deal. I'm sure they will come out and fix the caulk once I tell them about it.  Overall, I had a great experience from beginning to end and I now have windows that will hopefully outlast me.  They deserve more than just two stars on Yelp.  Seriously.”
- “Renewal by Andersen as a company has excellent service, quality, and integrity. We have now worked with the Renewal by Andersen Tucson team twice now. Upon contracting with Renewal by Andersen measurements were taken not once but twice. Quotes were provided in written documentation by Michelle Stephany, and because we were concerned about water damage due to our previous faulty windows, it was noted where we may see a fluctuation in the quote based on what happened when they opened up the walls.   We did not give them an easy task. Our first installation included 8 windows, including two windows where doors currently were, and a set of French Doors in an older home, built in 1959. The windows went in perfectly, I attribute this to their attention to detail and the fact that they came out to verify measurements before placing the order. They also contracted a masonry team to convert the doors to windows which was such a load of us. The French Doors went in without a problem but the screen door did not close properly. The install team made sure I had someone out to resolve this matter within a week.  Our second installation included 11 windows and a sliding glass door. On this install we had Steven and Earl who were incredibly nice and very understanding of our baby, toddler, and dog being on premises during the install. They were sweet to all of them including the 3 year old who asked Earl question after question. They also let us know when things were going to get loud so we could move the kiddos and dog out of the way.    Both the install teams were immaculate and kept our house free of any additional debris. This says a lot as we also had two doors converted to windows which required additional masonry work. Having two young children and a dog means that keeping the house clean and safe for them was incredibly important.   I am constantly impressed by now only how stable the temperature is now in our home but also how much quieter it is. The aesthetics are also beautiful and their no-see screens are virtually invisible. Their catch phrase is spot on: I truly love my new windows, and doors! I would recommend this company to anyone.”
- “It went very well. Doug the sales representative came to my home and was very helpful with informing my wife and I about there products. It took about 2 weeks for the windows to be made and the windows were installed in about 10 hours very fast in my eyes. The Installation crew was two gentlemen Stephen and Brodie they were great. They respected my request to do the bedroom first since my wife works overnight and was quite enough for her to sleep. I am impressed at how it has changed the temperature in my home and my utility bills have gone down. I am also getting compliments from my family and neighbors were also impressed. I will be useing Renewal by Andersen again to replace my doors and last 2 windows in the future.”

- “My husband called this company for an estimate because they had over 4.5 stars on Google.... hundreds of reviews which are obviously fake. Yelp has strict algorithms that don't allow fake reviews so it makes sense why they have such a low rating on here and not Google. We didn't realize they had such a low rating until after the THIRD hour of having the sales rep at our house. Our appointment was at 2 pm. I had left to pick up my son from school and when I came home around 3 pm my husband was still slumped in the kitchen chair listening to the sales man. I thought he had to be on his way out but I didn't realize after one hour he was just getting started! He had all these sale tactics which were a waste of time. We just wanted a price. My husband had informed him that he has leukemia and had only been home from the hospital for a few days and was feeling tired, in other words - cut the crap and give us a price.... well the guy ignored this and kept talking and talking and finally when he was done he sat at our kitchen table for another hour writing up an estimate. We just couldn't seem to get him out of our house. We would have never imagined that a window company would pressure you so much. It almost felt like a timeshare presentation. It was now dark outside, and I didn't care to see the estimate any longer because I had figured it was a company full of lies. Their reviews didn't add up. They have a new company name - Dreamstyle Windows and it almost seems like they're trying to run from their bad reputation. Yeah, they'll replace your window as many times and you want them to if it breaks but that's because you're paying 3-4 times the value up front. I just can't get over the fact that the sales man felt like it was ok to stay from 2 pm through dinner time, with our kids running around crying for our attention, all the way until 7:30 pm. On top of that, with my husband complaining of being tired due to chemo. I don't blame ny husband for scheduling this estimate because that was what we thought it'd be -- an estimate like most contractors do (1 hour tops). Not a 5 hour long high pressured presentation. It was horrible. I cannot believe the salesman was this inconsiderate. The only reason he left when he did was because we were trying to be polite but finally told him, "You gotta go." He finally pulled out his estimate - $125,000 to replace all of our windows. We asked him to break it up per window and get back to us because at that point we weren't able to replace all of them at once. he said he couldn't. He said he'd talk to his boss and call us back and it's been almost 2 weeks and he has not called yet. I would never ever ever recommend this company.”
- “Their follow up is terrible. It's been now five months since we ordered the windows. We still don't have an install date.  When I call, I get our sales representative's voicemail. He finally called me back after I threatened to go to social media on his voicemail. I decided to post anyway because customer service does not return my calls and an email to corporate has gone unanswered. I do think the windows will be nice. Everybody that we know who has them loves them but you are certainly not buying windows from Nordstrom.  We shall see how the install goes. Perhaps the install dept. will be better than sales and customer service.  If I had a choice at this point, I would go shopping else where.”
- “The crew was fast, did pretty good work and I'm satisfied with the product. However, there was a threshold piece for our sliding door that they had to order. That was 4 months ago, no contact from anyone. I called the Project consultant (salesman who sold us on the product and the fantastic customer service that RBA banks on), he had a lady call from service department and she said someone from repair would call me that week (3 weeks ago). No contact. I called the service number and left a message, went on RBA internet service chat line, left my number, sent an email with my complaint --- No contact.   So, we have 4 more windows to replace and will use a local company next time. I paid $9000 for products that are incomplete and have been ignored for over 4 months.  I have 4 more windows to replace, WILL NOT USE ANDERSEN again”

- “I had never hired movers before and had only heard horror stories from other people.  Needless to say, I was nervous to hire movers, but after speaking on the phone with Carl a few times, I felt at ease.  Carl and his son showed up a few minutes early to our scheduled moving time.  They worked quickly and were very careful with all of our belongings.  They were friendly throughout the move.  My husband and I could not have been happier and would gladly use them again ourselves.  The only negative I have to say is that I would have liked a more accurate quote when I called on the phone, but that could have been my poor description of our furniture.  All in all it was really pleasant to work with them.”

- “DO NOT HIRE THIS COMPANY! They are a sham.  They are not registered and hide behind a brother-in-laws address on S. 9th Ave so as to avoid process service.  They had to be prodded to keep working or otherwise would stand around doing nothing.  They sat the oven down on a corner of concrete and it promptly fell over and broke the oven glass.  They failed to check and secure a large bureau and it fell to pieces.  They promised to pay for replacement to mollify me.  I went to the S. Ave address and insisted on meeting with Carl.  He finally agreed to meet me at McDonalds to get me out if his family's property, the address he lists as the business address.  For some reason, the Constable's office could not serve there, though I think they made a mistake.  I am refilling as I have found 2 more addresses for them.  I just saw their truck park there for the night, so it is valid.  If you need to sue these assholes, contact me and I will help you.  Let's report to the Arizona Corporation Commission, attorney general's office, Better Business Bureau, city of tucson and state of arizona business licensing and anywhere else.  Let's get these assholes shut down.”
- “The company came to my house to move my family to our new home. I had asked them to be mindful of the new house as we had just renovated for the last 4 weeks. They proceed to put a number of dents in the walls going up the stairs and at the landing.  While I was bothered, I was very angry when I went to use my dryer and it was broken. We called a service repair company and they told me that a mount that holds the motor of the dryer was broken. We were told that this was only possible from it being dropped or improperly lifted. This cost $125 for repair. We have attempted on multiple occasions to discuss with the company however they refuse to engage in a conversation about the damages. We were told once that we would receive a call back however that never happened. This dryer was working the morning of the move as I personally was drying clothes and apologized if it was hot when they arrived.   When my fiancé called again in a final attempt to discuss the matter and was told "We are not going to pay you, so stop calling" and then proceeded to hang up on him.   Carl and his son, who appeared to be hung over, were the two movers that day. They were unprofessional throughout the move, complaining about moving things upstairs to the second story (which I made very clear it was a two story house when I made the appointment) and the son was playing very inappropriate rap music with curse words and racist slurs loudly from his cell phone that was in his pocket.  I would never use this company again. Looking back, I took the most affordable way out however I would gladly pay more for a company that is professional and does not even ask if it's okay to drag your BBQ through your living room....  If I could give zero stars, I would.”
- “My experience was August 2012.  I would give zero stars if it were an option.  Initially, the representative from the company that I spoke with (on multiple occasions) was very helpful and friendly. I only need Arizona Moving Service to help load a U-haul with items that were already packed in storage. I scheduled their services a month in advance and called to confirm two days before my move date. On the day of, I called 30 minutes out from the scheduled time to find out if the movers were running on time. I was informed that the movers required 30 more minutes at their present location and that they were in Benson at that time which would require an additional 40 minutes of delay for commute back to Tucson.   Okay. No problem. I understand that moving/packing etc must be flexible. However, 10 minutes before the newly appointed time (30 mins after the initially scheduled time) I was contacted by the rep and informed that the crew was now running an hour and a half behind schedule and would still require the additional 40 minutes to commute back to Tucson. The rep proceeded to vent to me about the employee Carl who was presently in Benson and whom apparently "always does this." Admittedly, I raised my voice and the rep snapped, "I'm not sending the crew" and then promptly hung up on me.   Desperate, (because I was on a tight schedule to move 2000 miles) I called back and calmly tried to resolve the situation. The rep then informed me that he would not send the crew because in the past, when this happens and they send the crew way later than expected, customers end up refusing payment. I explained my situation and that I'm an honest person but that the worst that might happen is that I'd write a review online. The rep then yelled at me, "F*ck you! I'm definitely not going to send a crew if you're going to write a review online!" He then turned his mouth away from the phone and began speaking to someone else (obviously not hanging the phone up on purpose) and said, "That f*cking b*itch is going to give us a bad review! F*ck her! Stupid b*itch." He then hung up.  This is the most unprofessional company I've ever encountered, moving company or not. I immediately called other Tucson moving companies to help me pack the truck and each one asked who'd shafted me. NONE of them (three different companies) had ever heard of Arizona Moving Service. I lucked out and found a professional company to assist me within the hour. I highly recommend EZ Move for your moving needs.”

- “I purchased 3 breakfast jacks sandwiches and 4 tacos; what I was given was one less breakfast jack than I paid for. I called and was asked to come back immediately and they would give me one. I explained that I was 15-20" away and this would be extremely inconvenient----I inquired as to whether they could take my name and I would return in the next 1-2 weeks if I were in the area again. I was informed that in that case I would have to bring in my receipt and speak with the manager about being reimbursed or be given  breakfast jack. Unbelievable! I have better things to do with my time than trying to convince a manager this happened (even tho if I immediately went back this very moment they would give me With what I paid for and was not given). Won't ever go to jack in the box again.”
- “No...this location is not following COVID-19 safety guidelines. Poor service. Three people making food, yet it took over 20 minutes in the drive through. Not one of them wearing masks. Will not be returning to this location.”
- “Ordered online for the convenience, had it start getting ready. I made my way to the restaurant drive thru to pick up my order as that was my selected method, only to be greeted by no answer at the drive thru for 10 minutes. So I drove up to window and around building to not see any workers, I decided to get down and that's when 3 people emerge from the back. To top it off my order of mini churros was forgotten and I'm too fed up to go back. Very dissatisfied with how this place is ran, as this isn't the first time I've had issues at this location. Get it together.”

- “The folks are reliable, reasonably priced, and do excellent work.  I have a small house, but no time to keep it as clean as I'd like.  They do.  And the customer service is as good as it gets.  Can't say enough good things about these people!”
- “Clean house, fantastic, reliable, friendly and very professional. They are very flexible and willing to work with you to get the service you desire, plus a CLEAN house!”
- “I needed a cleaning service for my parents. I was calling from out of town. Cynthia took excellent care if me explaining their services and rates and getting us on the schedule right away. The women that came to do the cleaning were nice and very hard-working. My mom thought the house sparkled and was extremely satisfied. I cannot think of one thing that could have been done to improve my experience. Cynthia was the key to this successful outcome.”

- “I used this company for approximately 6 months. Each time the crew arrived late. The last straw was when two employees started arguing inside my house! Then they took the argument outside! All this was caught on my surveillance camera! This company had the nerve to still charge me! The company hires some shady people. You've been warned.”
- “I really wish there is a rating below zero. This company is extremely dishonest. I hired this company to clean my house to put it on the market but I was not able to check their work since I was out of the state for work. At some point I came back to Tucson to check my house and found out that they did NOTHING other than vacuuming the carpet and took my money, in a hope that I will never be back to check the house (the carpet area is about 300 square feet). The bathrooms and the garage were never touched, exactly the same condition when I left the house. Dust was not cleaned at all, etc. They told my realtor that they tried hard to clean the bathrooms and the garage but the condition could not be improved. It was a total lie since they never touched them at all and I was able to clean them up with no problem. They were simply thinking that I was out of the state so that they could cheat me. In addition, they left a list of work completed claiming that they hand wiped furniture surface/vacuumed under the furniture, and so on. The fact is all the furniture was moved out of house completely when they came in for cleaning. If you donate your money to charities, at least you will get appreciation and tax deduction but if you hire this company you just waste your money for nothing and even you might end up being in a trouble. A lot of viewers of the house walked away due to its poor cleaning condition. This company should close their business and stop cheating customers. I took all pictures of their work with witnesses for the future reference.”
- “Raised price of cleaning my house from $130.00 to $188.50. ($190.00 for 2 full hours) Along with the rate change the service changed. They did not dust/Swiffer under beds in the guests rooms and only dusted around the edges under the master bed. Dirty footprints and small leaves from outside were found under the kitchen rug in front of the kitchen sink. Some of the counter tops were missed in the kitchen. Baseboards skipped.....ARG! Mirrors had streaks.... I could go on but I need to stop for my well-being. I won't have them back. Too many choices.”

- “I have had multiple cars from this establishment. All were reliable and ran fine for years. Upgrading after improving my credit score. Any questions were quickly resolved by Fawn, Steve, or Dane. Yvonne the sales lady was extremely kind and knowledgeable. I had service done here on my car multiple times and it was taken care of with tender hands. I have had no issues with any department here.”
- “Where to start... Well let's start with other places. We were shopping for a suv or truck. We have great income, but we do not have good credit. We had been told by several other dealerships that they would be able to help us. Several dings to our credit later and they tried to put us in a cheap car. So our friend, who bought a car from J.D. Byrider, recommended we go talk to them. So we decided to try it, at this point we were getting frustrated. From the get go I could tell they were different. They didn't even show us cars to try and bait us. They explained that they get you approved first, so they're not wasting your time. The approval process took a bit. It's not a bad thing though, as they take the time to walk you through the process of everything and carefully explain everything to you. Then when we were not approved for the down payment we had, the company lent us the rest. Our first 4 payments are paying them back. That is 4 biweekly payments, we make our car payments biweekly, which is so much easier than one larger monthly payment. The service department stayed late to push out a suv for us so that once done with the approval process we would at least have one to choose from. We absolutely picked the suv they pushed out for us. Our salesman Manny stayed after closing hours just to be sure the deal was done. The owner Steve stayed after closing hours and walked us through each detail and page of our contract, which I might add includes a 24,000 mile or 24 month limited warranty.... On a used car! The last place we bought from had a warranty for just 30 days. The experience buying our suv from J.D. Byrider has been absolutely amazing. They're a company that cares and will do whatever it can to get and keep you driving. A sincere thank you to every one on the team for helping our family, we are grateful to say the very least.”

- “As you all can tell by the reviews dane is the worst one here clearly he's living a miserable life probably lonely needs pussy but i wouldn't recommend this place at all.”
- “I don't write reviews but this popped up on my phone after I left this place and it was such a horrendous experience I feel obligated to warn people to avoid this place at all costs. My girlfriend had financed a car at this place. She let her son take the car on a cross country road trip for a couple weeks. While the kid was gone they checked the GPS on the car and assumed wrongly that the owner had left without paying. She was told by Dane that they had tried numerous times to contact her about the car being out of state. Only none of the numbers they had on file were contact numbers for her or her kid. Not only was there no phone contact but there wasn't any attempt to contact by email either. So the kid gets back into town, and not an hour later they come and repossess the car. The payment was six days late. All their stuff was still in the car so we went over there to get it all. 50.00 storage fee to get their stuff, and they mysteriously lost some expensive items too. They won't even allow her to make the payment to get her vehicle back. She has always been on time with her payments, but instead of working with her they would rather be assholes. They are absolutely the worst car dealership in town. It's a scam to prey on people who don't have good credit. They even bragged about screwing another customer over twice and were reselling that person's vehicle. DO NOT BUY A CAR HERE. Tell anyone you can to not buy here either cause they are dirty rotten crooks. Snakes waiting to squeeze whatever they can out of you.”

Only issues I've had have been with billing but for the most part that was addressed. I'd tell anyone looking for a PT place to check them out.”

- “The visit with the pelvic-floor doctor was good (she adjusted my tailbone and measured various muscle strengths) but my interactions with the staff were awful. 1. Untimely replies to telephone calls. I called on three separate occasions to schedule my initial appointment and left messages. No one returned my calls. Had it not been for the high recommendation from a friend in the healthcare field, I would not have persisted. My friend did specify the Wilmot office but on my fourth call I was referred to the Tanque Verde office as Wilmot had no appointments for 3-5 weeks (I should have waited, but my deductible was paid up for the year).  2. Billing & staff below average. My first visit I waited 20 minutes before anyone even acknowledged my existence, two front-desk staff were arguing loudly with a woman about her insurance. I was calm and accepting. The staff member behind the desk who took charge Michelle (I believe) was curt. I admit that I didn't see the sign-in sheet but mainly because it was to the side and I would have had to step into the argument"s line of fire to see it. I went and sat down. 10 minutes later Michelle called my name and said I owed $10, unpaid deductible. I said my deductible was paid up for the year; I had been in the hospital the week before so several doctors, hospitals, the ER, etc., had checked. she said she had just spoken with my insurance (I should have asked for the person's name she spoke with). But I paid the $10 mainly to get rid of the b---h, no reason to ruin my day, thinking when the insurance claim came through the $10 would be settled. Wrong. The office/billing department claims I still owe $10 (another?) for this appointment but that they have "moved on." There is no listing of my paying anything for that appointment in their records but my credit-card statement shows I paid it. I wasn't going to fight over $10. My recommended plan was 12 weeks of visits: 4 with the doctor and the remaining 8 with therapists.  The next two appointments I waited again patiently. The Doctor had to come see if I was there (I was) both times as she was back there waiting while I was up front waiting.  I got caught in a traffic jam due to a death on the Interstate for the third appointment and called as soon as I knew I would be late. Wayz estimated 25 minutes. Should I still come in or re-schedule? No one returned my call. When I came rushing in 20 minutes late, a gentleman in scrubs said, "Oh, you must have been the call. I didn't feel like answering it." Luckily the doctor was still available.  As a new calendar year was upcoming, I asked the front staff what the bill would be for 2019. The first time I got an immediate reply, "$80." I thought that low and said so, but the staff member said she had checked. I asked if that would be the maximum. "Yes, $80." I was assured. I asked a different person and she got on her computer and flipped open a notebook and said $80. When the claims finally came through insurance two months later,  my total was $104, the $80 I paid upon entrance and an additional $24. If I had been told that I wouldn't be complaining. Sadly, the invoice that arrived at my house stated I had co-payed $30, not $80. Their billing system is very confusing. Calling to get clarification was a mistake: they reply that I owe another $10. Ridiculous. 2. Therapy. As I stated the Doctor was fine but pelvic floor weakness was not a cause of my problems. and mine was too weak, primarily damaged by child-birth. The assistant/therapist was sweet but the exercises were super easy; except for the first session, there was no demonstration needed. A photocopy listing them would have sufficed. No elastic band was offered for home exercises. (Other PT places have provided those so at least I had one, they never asked.) I didn't need supervision. I feel like I've somehow participated in ripping off insurance. The 5th appointment they continued to have the doctor see me (contrary to the initial plan) and the therapy was not helping my condition so I canceled all future appointments. I was still waiting for the November claim to come through. I"m glad I stopped. Bottom Line: The Doctor and the pelvic-floor evaluation was worth it but I should have stopped after the four sessions. Try another location.”
- “Trying to call and make an appointment since Thursday,  did the online stuff.  No answer, no appointment.   Moved on and I have good insurance.  Teach your staff to answer the phone.  Not impressed.   And it appears to be centralized scheduling so this isn't an office issue.   Got another therapist with better ratings that answered the phone right away.”
- “The manager at the speedway location named Sam has 2 management positions at 2 different locations while attempting to keep patients with appointments to practice therapy on them. He cancels appointments constantly. They gave no experienced therapists at other locations like at river road. The only therapist there just got out of school a few months ago and has no experience to be in charge of a location. I've tried 2 body central locations who have both failed me terribly. They x's dried again yesterday on me. They have No Bolster seats yo go under your legs when lying down on heat. Their equipment is minimal and I've done no exercising nor have been through an hour of therapy since I joined. I'm quitting today in search of a physical therapist who offer post operative therapy and who don't cancel weekly or have the therapist cancel on me constantly. Very poor business practices at ever body central. I do not recommend any of their locations.”

- “Might be a little worn around the edges, but there's a clean bed, hot shower, working A/C and lights, free wifi and tv, and a buffet breakfast from 6-9a all for $50. Sounds like 5 stars to me; will definitely come back if I'm in the area.  Edit: after checking the other reviews, I should include that the walls are a bit thin. You can hear cars pulling up and people walking by. Might give this a pass if you're a light sleeper; I didn't have any problems.”

- “All you hear all night is NOISE NOISE AND MORE NOISE!. so many people are disrespectful to other that are actually trying to get some sleep. As a truck driver that what I stop at a hotel for SLEEP. there was a couple going at it all night. You could hear the bed banging against the wall. Then 2 in the morning the people upstairs just wanna party all night. You could hear the footsteps and people laughing. Ugh. The place it self was like a few hundred rooms was a stud together in a corner. The brakefast was just avergae. They had waffles oatmeal and toast. The way they design the brakefest was not prepare for the amount of people staying there. I suggest you wake up early right when they open or u be standing in line to make waffles and have no table to eat on. The room was very run down. The bed was comfortable and they had hot shower with flat screen tv, microwave and refrigerator. The toilet seat wouldn't stay up my husband got irritated about  it every time he uses the bathroom. The room has a two door set up one door to the kind of backyard. The walls are so thin and you could hear cars all night long. In the morning when I check out I asked for a receipt and the manager went all crazy say he won't check me out because my card was invalid. I had to call my husband from the car and bring my wallet. I check my bank account and I told how card invalid if it says it went through on bank account. Then he called the corporate and they been having problems with they system. He had had to apologize. I was so pissed..and all they ice machine was broken. Over all it was bad experience. DON'T COME HERE”
- “I've stayed at this location before, I love how close it is to the convention center, the act that they have free wifi and a "continental" breakfast is necessary but each time I stay there's a new horror to be discovered. The bed, thank God, looked, felt and smelled clean so no complaints there.  The staff, was polite, not friendly, she did say something about them giving me a horrible room and her fixing it, so thanks, I guess...  It was an upgrade from a single queen to single king which apparently got me a fridge and microwave I wouldn't have originally cause I called ahead to see if I could pack food or not and they said no.  The room smelled...like someone had hidden food under the bed and no one remembered till months later.  The fan didn't pay any attention to temperature settings, it was either on cool, hot or fan so it was impossible to find a comfortable zone.   But it was the bath that was it's undoing this time.  The tub didn't look clean, there were rust spots popping like blisters all over the rim of the tub, it dripped constantly- a shock since we're in a drought- and there was no cold water.  That's right, it went from off to scalding, no cold, warm, or hot.  I wasn't able to shower for 3 days- well I was able to clean myself with a wet towel from the sink but there was no stepping into that shower with the water running- it was too hot to bear.”
- “Not a good place.  Room had no smoke detector, most of the outlets did not work, toilet was not bolted down.  When we asked for money back was charged anyway even tho we were there less than 30 minutes”

- “The Gus' on 1st Ave is really stinky, of cigarettes, INSIDE, but the other store on Grant is even worse. I have been in both stores over the last 4 years at least 2 times each and it never changes. I would like to support a locally owned store, but I just can't stand it again. I am going to go to BevMo.”
- “I frequent Gus and generally find the staff pleasant and helpful. However on Tuesday 6 30 I had a disappointing encounter with Dave . Dave was on his knees stocking wine. He had a mask on but it was only covering his mouth. I asked if he could put the mask over his nose since I would be within 6 feet of him to select my wine. Dave became angry and told me he didnt have to put his mask over his nose. I told him I am a nurse and he is wrong. That he is contaminating customers by wearing his mask improperly.  He actually was arguing and I walked away. Did not feel safe.”
- “About 5 days, the cashier told a woman to "take her nigger dollars" and spend them elsewhere. Totally unacceptable.”

- “I love that this gym is open 24/7, inexpensive and not too large. I usually come in late around 10:00pm and practically have the gym to myself. I've been to other gyms as a guest and can say that Anytime Fitness has to be one of the cleanest and up to date. Plus the benefits they offer are really great --- including events, classes and exclusive offers for members. They are always adding new equipment which helps with switching up workout routines.”
- “Fantastic facility! My daughter talked me into coming to the gym. I really just went to get her to stop bugging me. I didn't want to go to a gym where there are a lot of "Gym Bunnies" and "Muscle Heads". I was pleasantly surprised. The majority of the people I have encountered are regular folks, friendly and just looking to get through their workout. It's a diverse crowd. Everyone is very nice and helpful if you are unsure or struggling with the equipment. I regularly see a trainer working with a client and they seem knowledgeable and encouraging. The facility is clean, bright and the equipment is well maintained. They offer Zumba, Yoga and Spin classes. Since coming to Anytime Fitness I have lost weight and I am in better shape now than I have been in years. I feel great and my energy level has increased. Our whole family (6 of us) now comes and works out. I encourage everyone to try this gym, you won't be sorry!”

- “Read the contracts thoroughly. I got the subscription when I was younger and living with my parents, so having the gym close was convenient. What I didn't see were the many clauses that try to dig through the wallets of their customers.  I decided I wanted to cancel my subscription, so I called to get it taken care of. I was told I had to come in to sign a cancellation contract, so I did. I was billed one day ago, but they told me I had to give 30 days notice, so they not only charged me for this month, but they're going to charge me again next month.  These kind of business practices can't be justified. They're purely in place to take advantage of the customer.”
- “Mallory is always on her phone and unprofessional. She lies to your face and charges way more. She charged during the shut down. She laughed when I told her she is overcharging when services are rendered. I would not recommend this place to anyone.”
- “It is very difficult to get a hold of someone when phoning this facility. It is also very distasteful to speak badly about the competitors to potential clients. I finally received a call back from this place and the gentleman chose to point out that people go to Anytime fitness complaining about Snap fitness because the owner won't turn on the television in the gym in order to cut expenses. First of all, anyone complaining about televisions being turned off at a gym is petty and pathetic. YOU ARE THERE TO WORK OUT, not watch tv. Even if you're doing cardio, focus on your work out people! You can watch television in your home all day every day. The gym is no place for a television. It seems extremely petty that people will actually complain about this kind of stuff. This conversation made me realize I made the right decision joining Snap Fitness. Thanks Anytime Fitness.”

## 1★ samples (Negative Reviews)
- “I Agree with Luna M.'s review. The lady is very rude, she followed my daughter around like a hawk, my daughter is 5. She made the shopping experience extremely unpleasant, not to mention her tone even with us as inquisitive customers was unpleasant. I've worked in retail for over 20 yrs and everything was not ideal, she doesn't know anything about business and communication to save her life. If you have issues with people unfolding shirts, then there are alternative to have shirts viewable to the customers without them needing to unfold them. Not to mention that as far as placement/ flow of the store/ items, the store looks hoardy and cluttered. Too much going on there.-Which only AIDS shoplifting regardless if you follow them around. DUH!! I WOULD NOT SUPPORT THIS STORE. Buy your Latin arts and crafts from another place, with real latinos/latinas- which are nice, pleasant, inviting, good business people, and LOVE children. She's giving the latino business community a bad reputation. Is this store part of the Latino Chamber in the area???? That's another burning question that begs for attention.”
- “Literally the only shop on 4th street that's not dog friendly. Too many other cool shops on 4th to waste anytime here.”

- “This was stupid. I rented a truck to go 10 miles to move a few large pieces of furniture locally. The rental was no trouble--the woman who processed it was very professional and courteous. But the return was a nightmare.   I had driven the truck (a 10-footer) exactly 10 miles, but it took almost 3 gallons to refill. When I returned it, I pointed out the discrepancy, thinking it was no big deal. Then some other employee (a man) came from out back and barked at me, "Did you check the gauge?!" I was taken aback by his aggression and snapped back, "Don't put this on me." He pointed to a sign that said they can refuse to serve anyone. I was livid! He then threatened to call the police! Is this their idea of customer service? I asked them to close out my bill so I could leave. While they did that I diffused the situation, but said it was remarkable that they assumed it was my fault. They told me they get people trying to pull stuff over them all the time. But I had driven it just 10 miles! What could I possibly be trying to pull?   I'm sure these are nice people normally, but they're pre-cocked in the aggressive position.”
- “I rented a truck for one day and the guy at the counter told me that I needed to return the truck the same time on Sunday (9:30 am) or I will be charged another day.  I tried to return the truck the same day and they were closed. The guy working there, who lives upstairs, came down and told me that I can leave the truck, but then told me there is no after hours drop off because of abuse. So, I drove home and returned at 9:15 am on Sunday to find out that they don't open until 10am. I noticed a sign on the front window that had a checklist for after hours drop offs and there was a drop box for keys. So he lied to me too. The truck had more gas than when I rented it.  They charged me for 2 days, then they charged me 2 other times after that, in addition to what I already paid, which made me overdraft and receive over draft fees.  When my wife went to the place to resolve the issue, they told her that they couldn't help her. I do not want to short anyone, but I do not want to pay what I did not receive. I used the truck for one day and now they are making me pay for 2? Or 3?? They advertise $29 a day and I somehow accrued almost $220 for a half day.  I will never step foot in this place again.”
- “Do yourself a favor steer clear. Piss poor customer service. Person on the phone had an attitude problem because U-Haul made a mistake. But yet there a U-Haul dealer. I returned the truck to a much better place just a few minutes away.”

- “We bought a Samsung Galaxy Fast Charge Wireless Charging Pad from this Verizon TCC store for $60.00. Also purchased my case there at the same visit, which both salesmen there said the charger would charge while it was on. Well, it doesn't. Now when we take the charger back they refuse to refund it. It's still brand new, in the box, only took the charger out once to try it. And to make things worse, they tell me they know it doesn't charge with my case. Even though we still have the receipt for it and everything. I gotta admit, one of the salesmen there, John, was very helpful. But his boss even knowing the situation refuses to refund it. We have been with Verizon for years and it all these little retail shops popping up are such a let down! They are all about making sales and lying, they knew the charger wouldn't work with my case but insisted it would.    I will never go back to this store.  I am not okay with sales people lying to my face.”
- “My husband and I went to this store after Thanksgiving. We bought 2 new phones and was told it was buy one get one free, however we would have to sign up for a new line. We were told that the line would cost just 10.00 a month. Well...I am now on my 3rd bill paying for a n extra line and both phones. I also bought a new iwatch and was told I would get 200.0 credit, I have yet to see that. I have called at least 8 times, I'm alway told the manager will call me back. Well one time he did and he said he would look into it and get back to me. Again I keep calling and no return call.  I called Verizon and they were amazing. They helped me. It make complete sense to remove the extra line at 45.00 and I immediately started saving 45. The fact of the matter is I only needed 1 phone when I went in. Now I have 2 phones and paying for both when I only needed one. I would never recommend this company and the manager Jesus as he never returns calls.”
- “Stay away from this store unless you like being lied to & letting them steal your money.  On April 18, 2016, I went into this store to inquire about a issue I was having with Siri on my iphone 6. After Karol helped me with this she asked if I wanted to upgrade to iphone 6s & get a free tablet for less then I was paying now & get out of my 2 year contract. It sounded good so I said yes. Even though it says right on the paperwork to read through it before you sign, you don't see it until everything is said & done because it is signed electronically. When she said I needed to pay $127.48 I asked what that was for & she told me taxes & such. While she was transferring my data from the old phone to the new one, she took the tablet out of the box & told me to check it out while she worked on my phone.  I looked at it briefly to see what apps it had & then it was put back in the box.  When I got home, I looked over the paperwork & noticed there was a charge of $49.99 for the tablet. I immediately called the store & Karol said that she said Cool Tablet not free tablet. I told her if I knew I had to pay for the tablet I would have never done the deal & would bring everything back the next day.  The next day I returned everything & Seshan (the manager) refunded $17 - he charged me a $75 restocking fee for the tablet & $35 for the phone because they were taken out of the box.  I explained I didn't use the tablet & he said he would email corporate about getting the charge reversed. I asked him to CC me & although he said he would, he did not. I've talked to him several time about this since then & he's lied to me every time saying he would send another email & copy me. I explained Verizon told me I should have to pay restocking fee because I returned it within 24 hours & never used it. Seshan told me this is Verizons policy & not TCC's and they worked independently from Verizon. I asked who his manager was & how I could contact him directly. He told me his name is Mike but you can't contact him.    Deal with a Verizon corporate store.”

Listen, you'll get bad reviews because it's jail, but please at least let us sit somewhere for 24 hours and at least have a cold hard bench so we aren't sitting in human waste. Come on, not all of us are guilty. I have no controlled substances for my meds so please get them since you have a nurse.  I was mocked because I asked for a sandwich, and when I addressed my concerns I was told, "you're in jail."  Just give people their meds at least.

- “A moment of convenient weakness has once again led me into the hostile arms of my pretender friend: the Grant-Alvernon Subway. *le sigh* With an employee change, I was hoping there was an improvement, but somehow no.  Different employees = different problems, but the old issues of grumpy+slow service and a complete lack of listening skills is still there.  All I wanted was a simple all-veggie club. Why do I have answer that I don't want cheese 3 times with 2 people AFTER Person 1 tells Person 2 that there's no cheese on my sub? If I'm not acting irritable about this, why is the employee becoming aggressive and rude? If mine's ready, why am I waiting for three other subs to be toasted and bagged first?! Why is it that when I say I want "all veggies", I find no peppers or pickles in my sandwich?! Must I brave bad tempered, snappy service for a lousy sub?  Old problems + new problems = 1 star. Goodbye Subway. Jimmy John's has proved to actually be there for me when it counts. I think I'm unfriending you.”
- “Going to this Subway was some of my worst experiences ever. The employees dont seem to be trained on how to deal with customers appropriately and are almost always hostile.   The straw that broke the camels back was when I went in one day to order a footlong ham sandwich which is normally $5. It just so happens that this month was a special in which you can buy a 6-inch ham for $2. So I figured that I would just order the footlong to save the person making my sandwich the time of having to make two 6-inch sandwiches. Wow, was that a mistake. I get to the cash register and she rings me up for $5. I tell her that they have a special for $2 per six inch. She then begins to argue that I should have told her that before she made it! I was stunned. I walked out. I will never return to this Subway.”

I usually dread going to the doctors because of ridiculous wait times.... but at Northwest they got me in to see Dr. Miller before I could even finish my paperwork and 10-5 minutes before my scheduled appointment.  Dr. Miller and her assistant Michelle  are amazing! I had been to three different doctors with the same concerns. My symptoms would go unnoticed or would not be taken seriously. Dr.Miller asked all the right questions and got my lab testing immediately! I was then diagnosed with the illness I believed I had. I can't be any more appreciative! Now I am able to manage my illness. Thank you so much. Would definitely recommend this office to everyone I know!”

- “Went to this urgent care on Sunday.  Check in was easy and staff was friendly.  Was taken to an exam room and had the staff take my information.  So far, I was very satisfied.  After sitting in the exam room for 80 minutes, I walked over to the staff in the center and said that I was leaving.  They said we will charge you anyway.  I stated that if they needed to charge for the check-in, I understand.  But I could not be charged for the physicians time, I had not seen the physician.  Then the physician starts litteraly screaming across the room, I will be there in a minute.  She was so loud and obnoxious, all the patients and staff could hear her regardless if she was in a room or out in the open.  She immediatly walks in, gives me her diagnosis, and walks out.  Now I have to wait for my paperwork. Well, it is another patients paperwork, so I wait longer.  When I finally go to check out, no one is at the desk.  I leave and need to return the following day to pick up my driver's license and insurance card which is only returned at the check out desk.  I called the office manager three times, never received a call back.  With all the mini clinics and urgent care locations in town, just keep driving to the next one!”
- “I believe all Northwest Allied Physicians are related so this is for the one on Swan Road in Tucson.  Highly DO NOT recommend Quik Med on Swan Road way overpriced.  My husband doesnt have insurance he went there because he had had the stomach flu and their was some eye discoloring he wanted to make sure he was ok.  It cost $100 dollars just to walk in the door, then they charged him another $60 dollars to listen to his heart, look at his eyes, listen to his breathing. He was sent home and nothing was wrong.  They wrote a prescription for blood work.  He  was there in the room approx 15 minutes.  We paid then though i found them to be over priced it was too late he was already there.  Then today i get a bill another $47.20 because they didnt do the math correctly at the Swan Office.  Why the heck is there cost so high??  For the services they provided it should of been 1/2 of that.  I cannot even imagine how much they ripped off my insurance company for charging for any services i had done.  There has to be someone out there not wanting to rip off the uninsured or for that matter the insured.  Again I would NOT RECOMMEND THEM.”
- “Ok. One strike is bad...but two for a visit deserves one star. Northwest Allied Physicians / Urgent Care at La Paloma on Sunrise first gave me an inaccurate prescription and I had to return to their facility as well as the pharmacy in one day. Additionally, I have been billed for a $30 copay I already paid at the facility. I've been told they don't do the billing and it's an insurance company issue. Additionally they will push their doctors on you if you have no primary. Beware. Go elsewhere. There are a lot of other urgent care facilities in Tucson.”

I have always recommended it to outside people or have even bragged about it to touring guests. I have got to know other people at the complex and it is typically laid back. I have never had any issues with the manager or the maintenance staff. This will be my third year living there and yes there isn't granite counter tops, but it is far more spacious than a lot of these other student housing apartments.”

It is simply ridiculous and the fact that the apartment doesn't want to maintain their units for a new tenant shows how much they really care about your money rather than their apartment.  Another issue is that when I moved in, I indicated that I didn't have a screen on my window and maintenance has failed to give me a screen for my bedroom window. One thing I noticed when I first moved in is that the first week of school, there were A LOT of work orders from other tenants. All apartments have issues here and there but with that many work orders, this apartment gives the appearance of looking run down.  However the office people are usually friendly. There was one time I encountered one of the leasing agents being rude to someone on the phone but they usually tend to be nice. Besides the window screen, usually maintenance attends to work orders in timely fashion.   The club house is alright. The computer lab is convenient for printing out things (printing is free, bring your own paper though). However sometimes when they run out of ink, they don't replace it for two weeks so you can't be too dependent on it. Also the club house must have bad security measures since there has been a homeless person sneaking into the club house at night for three months. No one goes to the clubhouse gym since most of the equipment is broken. The laundry room is small but they just recently installed new washer/dryers that are nice. The pool is okay, I barely go there so I don't really have any input on it.   The only great thing about this place is it's proximity to campus. Also I like the layout of the apartment and the size of the apartment may be small but isn't too bad.  I wouldn't really recommend this place to anyone. I would give two stars for this review but because Campus Crossings has been negligent to maintaining their carpet and features in their units, this place deserves a one star. The apartment is pretty old, hopefully there will be apartments close to the campus with affordable prices and good quality.”
- “I would not recommend living here. The pool was empty for half of my stay, there were many problems with the apartment including the AC breaking, the disposal breaking, the cabinet not closing, etc. They are also extremely harsh on towing and towed multiple cars including my roommates when she had bought a new one and didn't receive a parking sticker yet. The maintenance takes a very long time to respond, and same goes for responding to voice messages when the office are closed.”

- “BEWARE!!!! these people are rude and nasty, unfortunately for me I had to contact them regarding my car that got towed from their parking lot....I was a guest of one of their tenants and made the mistake to park on the property's parking lot, I contacted them to ask why a resident's guest would be towed and the person I spoke to me raised her voice saying I better not park in the lot or it will continue to get towed! and that I can grab the information from the sign, CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ITS WORST! Wait it gets bettter I obtained the number for UNIVERSITY TOW and the guy who answered first quoted me $245 then came down to $220 so I agreed to meet him and when he showed up without my car and demanded that I pay him cash I thought it was a scam so I told him I would pay him when he came back with my car then when he showed up with my car he started using derrogatory language and cursing me out, calling me names, why would I be surprised look who they do service for ZONA VERDE AT THE UNIVERSITY!!! Classy NOT... NASTY AND RUDE ALL AROUND.”
- “Please do yourself a favor and live ANY WHERE ELSE. To start, there is construction across the street which starts everyday (including weekends!!) at 6 am and does not finish until 5-7 pm. They have also begun construction work at 12 midnight sometimes to pour concrete! We were not warned of the construction project when we moved in and i cannot explain in words how terrible it has been. And as if it were not already hard enough to get a decent nights sleep with all that going on, the walls are paper thin so you WILL hear EVERYTHING your neighbors are doing and everything happening outside. There is also yard work going on right outside your window at 7 in the morning. This is the main issue with the complex. The internet is spotty at best. Twice I was trying to take an exam online for school and the internet out of the blue cuts out, causing me to panic and in one case, FAIL an exam! The staff is not helpful at all. There was a routine inspection, which we were warned about, of the apartment to make sure everything is in working order. They told us they would come in to fix a few things, the lock on a bedroom door and an outlet that did not work, but we never had anyone come by to fix these things! When we moved in the apartment was DISGUSTING. Mold all over the bathroom and COCKROACHES in the kitchen! To make things worse, my car was broken into while parked in the parking lot. There is no security whatsoever, which means it is very easy for people to break in and not get caught. The office staff always make it seem like you are a HUGE inconvenience when you come in during open hours to ask about things or pick up a package, they are always very unhelpful and rude. On multiple occasions our water has been shut off for with NO WARNING, sometimes we are warned maybe an hour before the shut off, sometimes after it has occurred. All together this place is NOT WORTH THE COST!! I noticed they just increased the rent and they have not made any improvements to the ground or apartments whatsoever. Be warned, they will try and squeeze every penny out of you during the rent agreement, literally everything will add to your rent, like living on the outer edge of the property, having a dishwasher, having nice flooring and cabinets and having a nice stove, etc. Do yourself a favor and LIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE!!”
- “Do not live here if you have other options. First, expensive place to live and there are so many better and cheaper options nearby. Second, walls are paper thin, you could literally hear your neighbors are banging with super loud noise in your bedroom. Third, every Tuesday or Thursday early in the morning, you hear someone weeding outside with this super loud noise to wake you up in the early morning. Last, the first day I moved in a lot of amenities did not even work.”

DO NOT COME HERE!”
- “Terrible service. I've been there twice and was disappointed both times. 2 weeks ago I bought a breakfast burrito with chorizo and it was dry and burnt and the service was terrible. The girl at the counter had a friend behind the counter and they were texting and carrying on a conversation with each other and someone on their phones. I saw they had a sign advertising Menudo and when i asked, she said they were out or they hadn't made any yet. I went this morning and there was nobody at the counter even though there were customers waiting. After a while a man came out of the back.  I asked him if the menudo was fresh and he said it was so I ordered it. That is the absolute WORST MENUDO I have ever seen. The meat was all overdone and slimy and there was barely any corn in it. as I was leaving another customer came up and was complaining how terrible the menudo was.. I remember when this store was run by 2 ladies (Las Cuatas) and it was our favorite place to eat. We were anxious for Los Betos to re-open , But we are extremely disappointed. We'll not be back and will advise our friends as well.”

- “I got referred to Dr Cooley after I was diagnosed with needing hip surgery.  He recommended a cortisone injection prior to surgery but had another doc administer that.  Patient never informed.  He then gave me 4 weeks to lose 20lbs and told me to do leg raises before he would schedule the hip replacement.  This while I can barely walk and make it to work driving.    He told me not to bother coming in to the follow through his MA because I didn't lose 20lbs.  PATIENT BEWARE-that's sign of someone in the business to make money and not a very good doc based on the other reviews.  So I fired Cooley”
- “Had a visit for a Fractured ankle. Went in for my initial check ($125) and he said the xrays looked like everything was on and wanted to see me again in a couple weeks for a follow up. Went in for the follow up and it was a exact repeat of the first visit. Took off my shoe, he checked swelling and bruising. Said everything looked ok and that I need to set up physical therapy. I got charged $805 for that visit. Billed as a surgery consult. Called to ask about it and they explained that it's billed that way regardless if I need surgery or not. This place is an insurance fraud nightmare. I was charged $930 for 2 visits that took all of 10 minutes total. Go literally anywhere else.”

- “I'm currently living in DC area and it's hard to find a decent dentist around this area. I have been coming here for years before I moved out east for graduate school and work. Eduardo and the staff are truly amazing. Not only that they are flexible with scheduling because they do understand that life happened and sometimes some things are beyond our control but they also take the time to explain about dental care, breaking down the costs, making recommendations, and treats you as if you're a part of the family.”
- “Eduardo and the staff at this location are truely amazing! Our family of 4 have been going here for yeara and I wouldn't bring my family anywhere else. They're flexible with scheduling and take very good care of our oral hygiene. If there are additional services they are able to explain any costs associated, well as make recommendations for you to consider.  Thanks to Eduardo I enjoy every visit.

- “Bad customer service, I'm never coming back this place. When I arrived for my apt was told my ins was inactive  the lady at the front office was giving me attitude because my ins showed termed. They never called or left a vm to let me know before my apt. I asked why I was not informed because this could've been handled before the apt. The lady was very unprofessional looking and had no customer service skills. She said she left a voice message for me then she started helping other patients when I was the first in line. I checked my voicemail and Had NOT even one message from the office. I called my ins to find out I was active since 2012. The front office staff was not wearing scrubbs not when I went to my appt. One of the ladies who collected my copay who also was rude, no scrubs had a cleavage. Not good appearance for a denta office!”
- “Absolutely and completely unprofessional. I showed up for my 8:00am appointment only to be told that it has been rescheduled to May 12th at 8:00am. That is 2 months from now. This is the second time this has happened. Each time I have been told, "We don't change the appointments without calling you." Which, as it turns out, is inaccurate.   I have actually been seen here one time. I thought the exam and cleaning would be the same day. Little did I know that I would have to schedule a cleaning one month after the exam (the appointment scheduled for today). I will not be back. The rescheduled cleaning has been cancelled, and I will be finding a practice that will follow through with the very basics of keeping appointments.”
- “The Receptionist that handled my paper work and payment received was with impersonal behavior and should not be dealing with the public , I had my x-rays emailed to this office and she denied they were received she lied and told me there no records while another lady found the email , No remorse or apology just acted like I was the problem. Everyone else was very pleasant to work with and Dr. Rene Laos was excellent . I really was disappointed in which the receptionist represented your dental office and will seek another professional dentist to complete my dental work.”

- “The business owner values profit over communication and customer service, and clearly upcharges for the work that is done. I went for a $29 Angie's List diagnostic special for my HVAC unit, which seemed like a bargain, and which I paid for separately. For the repair I was charged  $618 "flat rate" pricing for a ~$200 part and less than 1 hours of time at my property. The repair charge was not broken down by time and materials. It took 2 days of frustration and runaround to reach to company owner. When I requested to see a breakdown of costs, the company owner became contemptuous, rude and disrespectful of me as a value conscious rental property owner who needs justification for pricing and a legitimate cost breakdown. He further attacked me personally in his response to me on Angie's List; you can look it up to see how he feels about customers who ask too many questions. I have in hand written bids for the same work in Tucson which are HUNDREDS of dollars less than I was charged. Furthermore, the website for this company boasts a "100% Satisfaction Guarantee" which states that for any reason, they will refund your money if not satisfied.  Apparently this is not true, because the owner does not feel that my reasons for dissatisfaction -- overcharge, rudeness, and disrespect --are not valid. Look around and find a better company!!”
- “Would not recommend this company.  Never showed up (all 4 times) during the time frame we were given, never called to let us know of the delay and on final visit lied and told my husband I had changed the appointment. This was untrue.  Did not happen.  Very disappointed with their service and unreliability.  The Westras.”
- “Called Total Comfort to see why the igniter on my Amana furnace would light up but the gas wouldn't come on so it would light.  They told me they had a special and  it would be $69.00 for the service call + parts.  When the technician came out, he began diagnosing the problem.  He said it might me the mother board.  I asked how much that would be.  He said it would probably be around $600.  I looked the part up on-line.  Found a new Amana mother board for $57.00  After further testing he determined it was the furnace limit switch.  I asked how much that would be.  He said it would be about $280.00 for the part, plus the $69.00 service call.    He didn't have one on the truck so he bypassed the part.  It's only two screws that hold it to the plenum (lower duct work from the bottom of the furnace), and a wire that plugs into each end.  He came back out, but said the part was wrong (the switch comes in a "normally closed" or "normally open" configuration that will automatically break the circuit if the temp gets too high in the plenum.  I decided to check on-line for the $280.00 furnace limit switch.  I found it for $7.25  I emailed Total Comfort to tell them I did not want the technician to install the "$280.00" furnace limit switch.  I also called the office to reiterate I didn't want him to come out to put the $280.00 furnace switch in.    He showed up today, anyway.  I told him there would be no need for him to bring his tools in, since I'd had someone else put the $7.25 part in.  I asked him where he came up with the amount of $280.00 for a $7.25 part.  He just said, "I don't know", in a mumbled voice.  I told him to give me an invoice for the $69.00 service call and I paid him.  The technician was a personable guy, but there is nothing ethical about saying it would be $280.00 for a $7.25 part + the $69.00 service call, for a total of approximately $349.00   I expect to pay some markup for a part - but not get my knickers ripped.  Remember, this is a $7.25 part that is held by (2) screws and a wire plugged into each end.  We're talking less than 5 minutes to do it.  I can't help but wonder how many other people have paid for things like this, not knowing they were being grossly overcharged.  I personally would not recommend them, but that's just me.”

- “I have seen Dr. Zacheis for my severe allergies, He has been very through and helpful, and he has a nice manner about him.”
- “Dr. Carlson is an AMAZING provider! My PCP under-treated a severe sinus infection that rendered me very ill for about 6 weeks. I have seen Dr. Carlson previously, and he takes these infections seriously, prescribing accordingly. If not for a strong antibiotic (and the CORRECT antibiotic) prescribed by Dr. Carlson, I would probably have been hospitalized. Additionally, the office staff is very compassionate and equally concerned about the well-being of patients. The Practice Manager, R.N. Carlson, who happens to be the provider's wife, is equally competent and patient-centered. All of the staff are very nice and also helpful, especially Alicia. My only "complaint" is that Dr. Carlson is a specialty provider and not also a PCP, because doctors like Dr. Carlson are hard to find!”
- “I have to disagree with the other reviews. I have been going to this office for over 10 years and never had a problem that was not taken care of. It sounds like a lot of people are having problems with their insurance companies and blaming the Dr. office. Hello, it's 2018 and a large portion of the responsibility for handing insurance is now in the hands of the holder. It's like this in many offices now days. I over paid once and was sent a refund. Dr. Carlson always takes the time to listen to me and I appreciate it.”

- “Little respect for other's time. I took my Mom in for initial appt. we were early. I took into account there would be paperwork. We could have done this online prior to the appt but were not notified it was an option.  We were handed a wad of paperwork my mother couldn't visually handle herself. I believe the staff should have asked these questions of her in a private place as opposed to our Q & A session in the waiting area. It would have been less repetitive and certainly less data invasive for her.  End result: her appt ran into dr's lunchtime. He/she left; mom was returned to waiting room; we were left sitting in waiting room until dr returned to finish appt.  Questions: who is the customer?  Is their time more valuable than mine?  The nurse sheepishly informed me of this change with the option of setting another appt another day or sitting and waiting. Really?  This entire situation could have been avoided by the staff doing THEIR job of data collection with elderly patients. Perhaps they'd like to pay me for the time I spent relieving them of the time and effort. I have a boatload of stuff to do AND what about my lunch?”
- “The front desk staff is the first interaction you encounter and simply put, they are unprofessional. I wonder how other clients feel about the service here.”
- “Re:Dr Zacheis. I had a very bad/mal experience with this guy in another state and I would never make that mistake again. I assumed,as most do, that the Dr was competent and had my best interest. Always get a second opinion!”

- “I wasn't even a member of Tucson Federal Credit Union. We found out that they have the lowest rates around. We are buying a used car that is still quite expensive. Our Vantage West gave us 5.4 % interest quote. We have been with them for years. I got online with Tucson Federal Credit Union.  I applied for a used car loan and within a half an hour, someone called me and told me we had been approved. At 3.75%I wasn't even a member then I started my membership online I never even had to go to the bank. Today I went to the bank to finish things up. My husband spotted the treats which are so much more gracious than a lollipop from the old days. Andrew was our loan officer and he introduced himself and everything went unbelievably fast efficient they didn't treat us like we were needy. The teller Barbara took all our information and printed our debit cards right there and then. It's that easy to leave your bank for a Credit Union that is accommodating. I was surprised that at the signing the rate went up .25% ? I guess they raised the rates prior to signing. I am going to switch my personal checking debit account over because I like their Style. Almost 1 1/2 points lower that will save me a lot and I appreciate it. Sometimes Money Talks and clients walk. I was thrilled with saving a lot of money on a car loan and my husband was thrilled with their goodie basket”

- “I Had an experience where I sold a vehicle to somebody who got a loan through this facility. Teresa wrote Me a check in my maiden name since thats what the title of the car was (not my ID) and said she would cash the check if I brought my marriage license in, since it wasn't in my current name. I went back a couple weeks later and they wouldn't cash their own facility's check without charging me $5. They can "break the rules" for their benefit but I had to throw a fit to get my check cashed for "free". They were so rude, Teresa acted like she was doing me a favor, after first refusing to cash the check without charging me. The disrespect was unbelievable, the teller didn't count my money, ask me what bills I wanted and never apologized. I just moved here and I tell you what, I wont be using this bank for my personal or business's. I would be mortified if a client of mine or vender was treated this way.”
- “If I could leave a negative 1 review, I would. This institution lacks customer service and commitment. They have one teller working, one directing "traffic" and another stuffing her face with food. They get away with treating customers as though they're on an assembly line. I just closed my account and went elsewhere.”
- “Look at the review that I left for the Speedway branch I applies to all TFCU. Lousy ATMs, I.T. people who cant make Zelle work, and "supervisor" who doesn't call back. I should have read the online review. I'm going to SunWest this morning, maybe I'll be able to get my money from them consistently.”

## Tips from customers
Ask for the bank manager he is very friendly and helpful. Also, the credit union opens at 10am M-F. Auto loan rates are 3.99%. No coin machine here; have to go to Speedway & Alvernon. Closed account after many years ? Big lines & wait on oracle nov 1. Friendly service, online banking, and good parking available. The manager at this branch is awesome Worse banking experience ever. Do not recommend for anyone. Truly not a member bank nor do they care to retain loyal patronage, they discourage cooperation. They collection department has no people skills and treats everyone as a deadbeat regardless of the situation. Sara V is a crook and should be jailed for malicious practices. Shamefully unprofessional!

- “I live in the Vail area and have used DakotaPro since 2001, for the most part their down time was acceptable speeds where not the greatest by today's standards and I paid for an upgraded speed, which never met the advertised speed but was faster than my original so I settled.  The past few months (about 5) speeds have been problematic and service intermittent.  I would call and was told that "we upgraded our system and are working out the bugs" that conversation happened 3 months ago as of 21 April 2018.  Today the service is again down, what is different about today when I attempted to call Tech Service no answer.  In the past their 24hr service would always be available.  We would receive a detailed e-mail warning of an impending down time or an explanation of said interruption of service.  I believe the writing is on the wall I just took my own good time in reading it.  Packing my flotation device to jump ship I certainly have been very patient this past year.”
- “No customer service, internet outages weekly to bi-weekly. Unreliable service. Techs are good and do what they can but they're probably overworked with all the constant outages. Keep away unless you enjoy frustration and unreliable service and slow speeds.”
- “What happened? This used to be the best internet service, then Nathan apparently left. Yes, it went down a lot, but the tech guys, George and Nathan would get it up and running quickly. When it worked... it worked great! Now you can't get it working for squat! And the new tech people are an absolute joke! You can use maybe one device and only if that device isn't being used to do anything of any importance. They will change your service, throw you on a contract and then explain why you, the customer, should pay more for their crappy service. If I had wanted to be bent over I would have kept Cox!Horrible horrible service now.  Use Sulphur Springs WiFi or your phone as a hotspot (tether). Either will be better. DakotaPro will never be reliable or there when you need them.”

- “I LOVE IT HERE! The women are clean and Freeeeaky! You can eat tacos,wings, and suck toes! Do what ya like baby! They even have a day care in the back for the little ones. I'm here every day for the drink specials...I cant wait to ride the new bull they installed!”
- “Awesome establishment! The decor is unique and inviting all the while hiding the most hottest women in the state. Me and my husband have frequented topless bars all over this country and Raiders Reef continually ranks at the top of our list. I can't beloved the previous poster was shocked that making out and groping each other is frowned upon. I guess if ya wanna do that go south of the border to Nogales or some of the more seedier parts Tijuana. Those people make a living off perverts. If your looking for a clean classy top shelf topless club this is your place. The girls were all tens and one 9, the food is delicious we could come just for the food alone. Mad respect for the chef I would not be surprised if he was to be picked up by some clubs in Cali or New York. I also would not be surprised if most of the entertainers were ex models, or U of A girls because the beauty and talent on stage is some of the best I've ever seen. Truly a remarkable and erotic experience meant for only the true connoisseur of fine food and fine women.”
- “My husband and I love this place . I see these bad reviews and these men must be angry because everything I'm reading is not true. This bar has beautiful entertainers that actually talk to you . Great entertainment . They dont look like they hate what they do.  It looks weird on the outside but nice inside and bar food is pretty good and cheap.. The music is perfect . It's like a party with naked beautiful women .”

- “filthy club, beer mugs look like they've never been washed!”
- “This club is a dancers graveyard, dancers who have danced at the other clubs around town and are dropped cause they suck or old. there's high fees and expensive drinks, definitely stay if you want crabs or something, LMAO!!! I been here a couple of time's cause of buddies who I guess like this place for what ever reason. Also there's a lot of bouncers walking around so kinda puts me in stay alert mode so just incase shit pops off, LOL.   being honest, try it and decide yourself.”
- “This gentlemen's club appears to be for the dancers who have met their last days at the other clubs around town. It has a high fees and expensive drinks, definitely not worth the price of seeing the women that work here. There appears to be an excess of bouncers walking around which leads me to believe that there have been unsafe situations here.”

This place is legit..but the duke is a registered sex offender!!!

- “I'm sure the service you receive depends on the person you deal with. Frankly, I would only trust my big girl to Courtnie H.! I have a Great Dane that can be incredibly stubborn. Seriously, try making a 115lb dog go somewhere she doesn't want to go...it's a freakin' nightmare! However, Courtnie always seems to manage my Honey baby. She comes back to me happy, clean, soft and smelling wonderful. Total love and props to Courtnie, she is amazing and I wouldn't take my precious girl to anyone but her!!”
- “Here's the story of how the kindness of the manager at this location saved my dog from having to starve for 2 days....  I was in a hurry to get dog food on my way to work. Gotta be there by 9, so I pulled up at Petsmart about 8:15am. I'm on a big deadline and this is literally the ONLY time I have to get dog food in the next 2 days (oh, and I'm completely out of food at home).  Ran up to the Petsmart doors (which didn't open), and stood there puzzled because the sign said open at 8:00am...... The manager came and unlocked and opened the door, standing there like, "Can I help you???" And I asked, "Ummmm.....are you open??" - gesturing to the sign. Well - I'm a big idiot because the sign was for drop-off grooming!!! Gawd!!! The store doesn't open until 9am (OF COURSE!!)  I laugh at my mistake and turn to head back to my car, thinking my dog will have to survive on scrambled eggs or leftover takeout, but then the manager said, "If it's just something quick I''ll let you come in." Me = YES!!! Just a bag of dog food so Fido doesn't starve!!!   Woo hoo! I half run/half gallop to the dog food aisle, gleefully grab Fido's food, pay for it, and make it back home in time to feed Fido before rushing to work.  Maybe Fido would have preferred table scraps, but I'm thrilled that the manager took pity on me and allowed me to get the healthy, nutritious food Fido needs for a balanced diet. #Win!!!”

- “Used to take my pets to PetSmart for grooming,toys and food. After taking her there today for grooming, I'll be going elsewhere. I made an appointment yesterday to get my dog a bath and nail clipping today. When the  person checked her in today, she said they wouldn't be able to clip much of her nails and they would be left sharp unless I paid an extra $12 for nail grinding, I reluctantly agreed to the nail grinding. Then she said to stay near because her service was an Express so she would be done in about 45 min to an hour. I asked what an Express meant and she said they would take care of her from start to finish. Imagine my surprise when I get a call after about 20 minutes to tell me my dog was done and I can come and get her. I arrived and took my bill to the register to pay. While waiting in the long line for the one cashier, I realized the bill was $5.00 more for the bath than I had previously been paying. I got out of the line, went to the grooming place and asked when the price went up. I was told the service for my dog was now an Express and they added the Express fee to the price. Why wasn't this additional cost disclosed to me when I made the appointment, when I asked what Express was when I checked in or at any other time??? Between the misleading statements about the nail clipping and the undisclosed price manipulation, I'm out $17 I had not planned to spend. I would never recommend PetSmart!”
- “I came to visit the birds at lunch time and the poor things lights were off, no perches (besides a small metal perch for the largest cage which is unhealthy for them, they were fighting and cramming onto the small metal perch and the sides of the cage) they had NO FOOD. NO WATER. I watched staff pass them multiple times. As well as dead fish floating on the tops of tanks and dead beta fish on the shelves. This place is inhumane, I left feeling awful. DO YOUR JOB AND TAKE CARE OF THE ANIMALS”
- “I have never had such an awful experience. Every now and then we take our dogs to get groomed at PetSmart. After today that will not be happening. Being a pet owner who has no children, my dogs are my pride and joy and most importantly my babies. The lack of care and respect is insane. My oldest Shepherd/husky is a year old. He has been groomed at PetSmart 4 times in his short life. I was called and told he did great for his bath but once he was put back in his kennel he was winning and had dihareah. I got to the location as fast as I could to pick him up. They handed me the bill for him and I looked at her and said, "no I want to see my dog now" rolled her eyes and went back to get him. It took for 15 minutes to bring him to me. Mean time the manager of grooming came to me and tried telling me my dog was eating his poop and throwing it back up again and that he had a condition. I'm pretty sure you are a groomer, not a vet. Koda was shaking and so distraught. I felt so bad for my baby. She continued to tell me he was fine and just trying to get attention. I'm sorry, if my dog was distraught and throwing up, why wouldn't you tend to him? She was more mad that they had to clean a kennel out then worried about my dog. I grabbed my other two dogs that were dropped off and headed for the door. The grooming manager made sure to run after me and make sure I had paid for my awful experience. And proceeded to tell me it would probably be best if we didn't return.I will not be returning to PetSmart, not because she told me not to but because of how they treated my baby. Not to mention the lack of care in the grooming area and lack of knowledge on how to greet people when they walk in.”

## Tips from customers
Clean, not as unfriendly as the other I went to.
 Bathrooms are clean! My dogs are terrified of grooming at petsmart

- “This place has always been good. Fair prices and quality flowers. The service is always good and they go the extra mile when delivering flowers. I have seen them deliver flowers the same day even though I didn't get there til afternoon. They always have a good selection of fresh flowers and have a book there for you to pick out an arrangement, if you don't see what you like on the shelves. I would definitely recommend this store.”
- “Stopped in on a whim for an arrangement for a birthday, the woman who helped me was so friendly and helpful (wish i knew her name, long light brown hair) She took the time to trim and wrap them beautifully! The recipient absolutely loved the bouquet. I'm hooked! I'm constantly trying to find excuses to go in a buy flowers :) who does that?? Only a very satisfied customer PS wish I had a photo, the flowers are always beautiful. Will post after my next visit”
- “Edie did the flowers for my wedding and I couldn't be more pleased. I wasn't entirely sure what I wanted, but she offered suggestions and seemed to get my style. My bouquet and halo were stunning and coordinated beautifully with the venue, my hair, my makeup, everything. Perfect! I had a matching halo for the flower girl, which she adored, and boutonnieres and corsages for the rest of the wedding party. I'm trying to figure out how to preserve some of the flowers. They were such a special part of the day.”

- “Had the pleasure of "working" with Jessica, I say working loosely because it mostly consisted of her rolling her eyes, and throwing things around the shop. Not sure if I'd ever shop here again. Can't believe it could go from such great experiences to a shit one. Fire this ghetto ***** asap if she's to busy/rude to paying customers”
- “I ordered flowers for my wife for Valentines Day on February 10th to be delivered on February 13th between 8 an d 11 AM, charged over $85.00. On the 13th it was getting close to 11 and no delivery, I called the store and spoke to a lady who was extremely rude a basically was told that the flowers would be there when they get there. I asked to speak with a manager and then lady sure and hung up on me. This was not the end of the nightmare, when the flowers did arrive after 11 am, I was surprised how small the arrangement was and the 3 roses certainly did not meet the dozen that I ordered. The driver had already left when I looked at the arrangement and discovered a card addressed to another person. Turns out the arrangement we received costs about $39.00 and to top it all off the flowers we received were certainly not fresh because on Sunday morning they were falling all over the table. Needless to say I will search for a reputable business next time.”
- “Yesterday I ordered a beautiful arrangement for my grandmas 61st Birthday. When she sent me a picture, they looked nothing like what the description said was in the bouquet! I paid 60$, plus a 12$ delivery fee. I expect to get what I paid for. Especially for flowers that die in a couple days. I called, and the lady did say they were out of 4/6 of the flowers and fillers. Now that's a totally different bouquet!!! Most of it was Daisy's. They also told me they didn't call to let me know because they don't have the time to call everyone when they are out... but totally unacceptable when 4/6 are missing. They should definitely when they should call when it's that much. One or two I can understand. They really know how to bs their way out of a complaint.”

Great service. If I ever need flowers last minute, this is my go to place

- “Went this morning for breakfast with my daughter. It was very busy(people waiting outside). We were seated within 15 min. Our waiter Trevor greeted us promptly and was very polite and look genuinely happy! We had our drinks and order in. Because it was so busy we knew our food would take longer. Trevor came to our table to let us know we weren't forgotten and our food would be out soon. Trevor was very attentive in a polite way and our food was hot and cooked perfect. I live closer to the limberlost location but the Grant location is better all the way around!”

Nothing tastes better than pancake popsicles. When we mentioned to the server our issues, she decided to give the entire table attitude. I will make sure to not spend my money at this restaurant again and I will make sure my friends and family do not either.”

## Tips from customers
The food needs more flavor Don't worry about the waitress you get, they will be horrible. Horrible food good service. Go to another IHOP! Worst one in town! The service here SUCKS! The waiter can't handle a simple order  and manager is feeding his son and not waiting customer with his CELL PHONE RINGING "girls" by the beastie boys! Run! I wanna run!!! Paid $20 for a meal and cheese sticks The cinnastack pancakes are very good but a little dry towards the middle. So drinks are a must Spend your money elsewhere for breakfast other than IHOP. The service and food will be better anywhere else you go. Trust me, been there several times and always an issue with wrong food misplaced tickets or additions being found in food that did not belong there. Seated fast. Good food. Waiters are hit or miss. The service was great and the food was cooked as ordered. A bug in my coffee!! Awesome service by stacy! Very good selection, quality  and cleanly environment

Ask for a drive chain sold me the wrong chain. Took them 55 minutes to get the mower out of the back . Mower was there for a month. SERVICE SUCKS. EQUIPMENT IS OVER PRICED.”
- “This was the worst nightmare I have ever had in the 20 sometimes I have had power tools repaired at different locations. Not only does this establishment lack anything remotely resembling Essex, morals or good business in general but they are disrespectful rude and very unorganized! It took them over five minutes to locate my equipment due to their inability to spell my common name. They miss quoted us not only prices but work time and delivery was double the three to five day initial estimate. They lied and said the equipment would be available within one day of receiving Parts. It was not! I had to argue with the manager, a specimen named Mark, who finally after 45 minutes of verbally masturbating with me and making excuses agreed to repair as initially advertised and possibly discount the price in order to avoid having to put my equipment back together and have a total loss and a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Avoid this establishment like the plague and drive the extra 5 minutes around the corner 2 Grant and Glenn and see the fine folks at American Outdoor Power. They are very professional, quick to respond and communicate very effectively with no disrespect, lies or unethical business practices. You will be very glad you did. Read the other review related to Precision outdoor power and you will see I am by far not alone. Avoid this migraine and heed my advice friends”
- “I have tried to use them but they're not customer oriented at all. I've had much better luck at American Outdoor Power. AOP gives you a free estimate prior to starting a repair and they give you the old parts when they're done so you have proof the parts were replaced.”

- “We tried to look for a minute clinic for the hubby's strep throat and all appointments (via on-line) showed already booked, except for this Northwest Urgent Care at Speedway. It was a seemless on-line check-in process and we arrived to an empty lobby, filled out paperwork and were seen within 10 minutes.   They did not take his weight or height just asked him if he knew how tall and how much he weighed. An LPN took his vitals, an MA recorded the vitals and symptoms in the computer (Cerner EHR) and than within 3 minutes he was seen by Dr. Alvarado.   The longest part was waiting the 10 minutes or so for the strep test swab results that the LPN took after vitals were taken.   They provide an e-script to the pharmacy of your choice and let you go on your way.”
- “Haven't got the bill yet....but The staff at this urgent care were so awesome and went above and beyond when treating my fiances less that had glass lodged in it. They saw us within 5 minutes of us arriving and were friendly form the moment we got there. The nurse that attended to us was so kind and sweet and made us feel like we were in great hands. The doctor, Mr.Brandt was also great! He was super funny and laid back while getting the glass out of my boyfriends leg as quickly and pain free as possible. This has probably been the best urgent care we have been to in Tucson. Thanks again to the staff!!”
- “I have been here a good handful of times and for the most part the staff; nurses and doctors have all been really great! Today we went in for staple removal for my little guy and we saw Dr. Martin Brandt and he was spectacular!!! I have honestly never come across a more awesome doctor! My son is 4, he greeted him and made him laugh the entire time. He made him comfortable and we were in and out in less than 20 minutes! I wish he was a dr with his own practice because I would take all 4 of my kids to him!!”

- “There are two profiles for the same center so I will be posting to both.   I came here to get my blood drawn and I've never felt so insulted in all my life. The lab assistant Michelle was so utterly rude to me. I had to wait for a long time, maybe 30 minutes from the receptionist bringing her my papers to her calling me back. I was the only one in the waiting room and I heard laughing and chattering somewhere in the back. She made me spell out my name, which was fine, but she kept talking over me when I tried to ask her questions. Every time I'd try to speak she would just talk over me. I couldn't ask any of my questions at all. She was very rough with my arm and I had a bruise that lasted two whole weeks. I told her I wanted a butterfly needle because my veins are very small but she just ignored me and used a straight needle. It hurt so badly I wanted to cry. When she was done she basically kicked me out of the room, like it was such a bother to do her job. This was the worst experience I've ever had and next time if I have to come to this location for a blood draw, I will be calling ahead to make sure Michelle isn't there!”
- “Shitties fucking service I have ever had to experience as a civilian, and I spent 10.5 years in navy medicine( I know fucked up health care). The receptionist today (7/9/19) was very rude when I asked her about lab work. Turned me away even though I was from a different company (not listed to be denied services), so I dropped off my urine sample at the local Albertsons(thankfully there was an available, clean restroom out here in this plaza).   The admin department calls me to apologize that the receptionist of this Urgent Care turned me away, she was misinformed. So I turn around and head back in. They had an X-Ray tech doing the lab work (not certified to collect, package or process samples/ her demeanor and frustration with they process was very evident). She ushers me to the restroom to provide my sample and doesn't set up and clean barriers for my sample cup or the other contents inside to ensure a sterile sample is provided.   I provide my sample, she comes to collect it, and we head back to the lab. She start filling out the paperwork (which she has a cheat sheet for, just in case she misses any "i's or t's"). She tells me I'm good to go, and then to unsettle me even more with the experience she says "good luck"..... on a pre-employment drug screening.....  I don't do drugs.... now I'm panicking because: 1.) non certified technician is taking samples 2.) I had to deal with a lackluster performance from reception 3.) the closest thing to clean technique was me washing my hands 4.) my sample was carried, uncovered through the clinic for more pouring.... 5.) did I mention I don't do drugs..... 6.) oh yeah and this could decide my fate at getting a better job in this shitty economy.  What makes matters worse is I work nights, and she calls me after I've left and I've gotten home (+2-3 hours) to tel me that she messed up on the paperwork and that I had some other things to sign if I wanted my sample to be processed for shipping....  My entire sleep schedule trashed, come back in to fill out my name, the date, date of birth and a signature..... that could have been avoided if quality assurance was part of their mission.  I do not recommend dealing with them at any cost.”
- “No masks when they think nobody is looking. Talking to each other about nothing important or work related when patients are waiting to be seen. Unprofessional and not ok.”

Luis Rodriguez was beyond helpful and took the time to look up a part I previously ordered and invoice number to make sure my part was covered under warranty.  I can't thank you enough Luis and I will definitely recommend you to anyone!”
- “Bought my 2014 F-150 at Jim click Nissan. Love it. Salesman was very knowledgeable and understanding about everything. Big thanks to Kiko Lopez, go see him if you are interested in getting a car!”
- “Excellent service! I am a college student (not from Tucson) and they treated me with overall respect when I told them the issue with my vehicle, although I didn't purchase it at this Nissan dealership. I've been to other Nissan dealers where they were jerks whenever they asked if I had purchase the vehicle there and I had responded with a "I'm sorry, I did not." I had an issue with my vehicle due to a recall and they were able to get me in the very next day. Overall great customer service and respect from their employees. I am definitely going to come back here for anything else I need for my vehicle.”

- “Never buy a car from them. They make your get their Maintenance for Life which is just oil changes and tire rotation. Although they make it sound like more. Then it takes 2-3 weeks to schedule an oil change, and when you show up it takes 2-3 hours for the oil change to get done. I bought my car with 32 miles and have 30,000 now. Not once have I been told I needed an air filter or anything like that. Most of the time my car was "perfect". Then I all of a sudden need 4 tires, flushes, and other things. They don't care about servicing you as needed, because Jim Click keeps restructuring their pay to where they have to work more hours for less. Can't blame the people who work there for trying to hit you with expensive stuff.”
- “Worst dealership ever!!!  The salesman Spencer was great and I was assured by Raul in finance all was fine so I paid the down payment, signed all the papers, got the keys and left. Three days later the salesman asks me to come back and see Raul in finance. I do this and am told car price cannot be altered (finance problem) so take this other new car for a year, blah blah blah. I go home to decide if I accept that deal and when I returned yesterday whoa, now the price drops $4500.  Why couldn't they do that the day before? Remember taking care of the customer??? The management were rude and inconsiderate!!!  So I went to Chapman's Honda where I purchased a great vehicle.”
- “I brought my 2008 Nissan Rogue to Jim Click Nissan for warranty work after my transmission stopped accelerating on a trip to Arizona for my dad's funeral. They replaced the transmission under warranty. It wasn't fast, but it was done.   Then they dented and damaged the passenger side of my car. Read on for a story of comedic incompetence.   While driving from CA to AZ on a particularly hot day, my car stopped accelerating and the fastest I could drive was 40 mph. My passenger looked it up and found that there was a special warranty extension put on my car engine because it would lose it's acceleration whenever the transmission got too hot.  When I dropped my car off, I was first told that I would get a courtesy car, only to find out that there was not actually a courtesy car, but I could rent one at a place down the street that they recommended. Then, I was informed by my service advisor that there was probably nothing wrong with my transmission and it sounded like the fluid was probably low and that "there's a special way to pour in the transmission fluid that they only teach us at the dealership."  After confirming that my transmission did, in fact, need to be replaced, the Jim Click team had to bring parts in from CA, and had my car ready in 3 days (seems long, but okay).  It all went belly up when I picked up my car however and noticed that they had put a large-ish dent in my rear passenger door and a quarter size amount of paint had been gouged out of my front passenger door. After pointing this out to the person who brought my car forward, he had me wait for my service advisor who then came out to tell me that he would need to pull the security video to confirm the damage had been done there and would get back to me in about a week.  He never called.  So after about a week and a half, I called back and left a message.  Shockingly, he still didn't call me back. So I called a few days later and left ANOTHER message specifically asking for his manager to call me. Didn't happen. So I called again and after speaking to the sales department, I was able to get the email of the service manager.  I sent him pictures of the damage and received an email back stating that there had been damage assessed on my left front door (the drivers door) and the rear passenger door when my advisor checked in my car. I promptly emailed back letting him know that there still wasn't any damage to my driver's door and that the paint gouge was on the front passenger door and rear passenger door, but that my copy of the paperwork does not show any such assessment and there was not any damage to my car when I dropped it off. (I had done my own walk around assessment because I like my car and things like this stress me out.)  It's now been 4 weeks and I'm having to ask for his boss because he maintains that the damage indicated on the driver's door was dirt that was removed in a courtesy wash and the damage to the left side of my car was hidden by dirt.   Bottom line: Don't take your car here. Jeff Hovelson and Andrew Stewart didn't cause the damage to my car, but they're causing it to stay there and making the fix-it process a pain in the ass. (Although, their incompetence is becoming vaguely entertaining.)”

Make sure you make a note of who you have an appointment with, apparently they don't track appointments. No appointment? No problem! Do your homework before you go to Click Nissan.  When they tried to screw me, I walked.  Big waste of time.

We got the chimichangas with the works which included sour cream, guacamole, and beans, all for $6.95!  Can't beat the price and there was plenty of food to take some home.  We will definitely return!”

- “Horrible service! Good food and margaritas, but save yourself frustration and get better food elsewhere.”
- “We ordered catering for a small wedding of 30 people. They showed up over 45 minutes late; the guests were waiting at their table for 30 minutes. We called at the time they were suppose to arrive and offered to go pick it up but they said it was on the way.  After waiting awhile we finally headed down to the restaurant to see what was going on.  They talked to the driver and again assured us it was almost there so we left and still beat the food to the venue!! If they would have let us know it was going to be late we would have been more than willing to go pick it up. We are so disappointed in their customer service! I'm not sure they even deserve the one star...”
- “Placed an order by phone and went I got here someone had accidentally thrown it out so it was never placed. No apologies, awful customer service”

Five minutes from the office. Very consistent. Good food. Loved it for years and let me say BEST BEANS EVER Great service, good food & fantastic prices.

- “This goes for the entire Wells Fargo corporation.  They are so huge they cant even tell me a place/person to complain to that will even get the point across. The nickel and diming fees are out of control.  I have and am in the process of closing ALL of any of my accounts with any branch of Wells Fargo. Mutual funds (under the WF Advisors), HSA, Checking, and credit card.  And they will have no chance at getting my home loan business.  They charged me a $7 service fee on my formerly free checking and since it wasnt my primary checking I only had a token $5 in it, so THEN I get charged a $25 overdraft fee which they took out of my unactivated WF credit card.  I also have an over 4 dollar monthly service fee on my HSA which has a whopping interest earning of 29 cents per quarter.  We wont even go into the mutual funds/financial service fees.  ALL of my investments are never going to pad WF money grubbers pockets ever if I can help it.  They already got my tax dollars for the Big Bailout...not getting anything else from me. Credit Unions all the way from now on...”
- “One watch-out regarding the much publicized Go Far Rewards associated with the Wells Fargo Visa Card....  The COVID issue has provided me an unfortunate look into this program.  They are good about communicating with you when you are spending money or points on travel.  However, they are non-communicative when it comes to refunding your money or points when a flight is cancelled.  I've spent many hours on the phone with them since my flights were cancelled on 1 September (2020).  They refuse to confirm anything by email.  They promise to call back with requested information and never do.  We will be dropping the card.  If we don't get our points and money refunded in the next 30 days, we will be changing banks.”
- “I have been a Wells Fargo account holder for well over 10 years. Today I stopped in to simply see if I could have a car title notarized and I was told that I would have to wait five days for an appointment. What exactly is the point of having a bank if they can't even do the minimum amount possible for their own account holders?”

## Tips from customers
I avoid this branch like the plague but not for why you'd expect. The employees are GREAT but just overwhelmed by the traffic. Always a terribly long wait for me. No envelope ATM deposits... Very environmental friendly!

- “I bought a used Jeep Wrangler here on the 4th of July. These guys are great.  I did not feel pressured and they provided carfax info and kelly blue book quotes upfront without my asking. Jasen Lauver was my salesman and is more than awesome. The test drive was actually fun. He is honest and upfront with information and didn't try to up-sell me.  I benefited from the 4th of July sale but they really worked with me on the price beyond that. I have always wanted a Jeep but thought they were beyond my budget. Desert Toyota was able to make it happen for me. Options and warranties were explained to me concisely yet thoroughly but I was not pressured. I simply said no or yes to what i wanted and that was that. Hands down, this was the best car buying experience I have ever had. I left really excited about my purchase rather then exhausted. Jasen even helped me get the panels off the hard-top for me so I could cruise out of there with the top down!”
- “I was very happy with my purchase I feel like Kindra went above and beyond to make sure I had the best experience possible. The whole process was positive and I am very very happy with my new Toyota Camry!”
- “I just bought a car from Desert Toyota of Tucson, and let me tell you that the experience was Great! IF YOU WANT GREAT SERVICE ASK FOR JOE! He is a great salesman and he made my whole experience great! When buying cars I really hate the hassle, I was even considering going to carmax and dealing with them because the haggling is exhausting. But Joe made the whole process effortless. I am so happy with my decision to stop by there, and I feel very pleased with the whole process!!”

- “I went in today to trade in a vehicle for a new RAV4. My salesman, Winston Allen was awesome. He showed me several vehicles and options and is the only saving grace from this visit. Once I picked out the vehicle I wanted I sat down with the manager to talk prices.   They had a used 2014 RAV4 LE with 2500 miles and another 2015 with just 500. The sales manager came out with a sales price on the 2014 of $30,999. I thought it was a joke considering the exact same car, a new 2015 RAV4 LE with identical features, I researched with a sales price of $23,096. The manager looked at me like I was crazy when I told him a fair price was at best $23,000. So I went on true car.com and got quotes for the same exact vehicle (only brand new) at $22,446 from 2 dealers and the same $23,096 from a third.   The manager went back into an office with his counterparts to put together a better price and while I was waiting two dealers called from truecar offering an even lower price of $21,318. Desert Toyota came back at $23,999 for the used car and refused to match the 23,000 even price at the high end of the other new car offers to buy the same day. Then they claimed it was a "new car rebate" that made the prices cheaper from other dealers and took me over to the new car section who couldn't match the price of the other dealers in the state and come down the other $900.     I don't know what's worse- you sending me to look at new cars that are cheaper than your used vehicles in the same make and model, your inability to match prices (it's 2015, you can price match almost anywhere, including the other dealerships who matched the $21,318 immediately), the two hours I waited for you to figure out your prices suck and come back with other offers, or the fact that you came down on price by $7,000 and still wanted to sell me a vehicle above MSRP on your website.   The sales managers parting words to me were "they are probably going to low-ball you on the trade in to offer that price." The problem is- I never mentioned a trade in to the other dealerships. The price offers stand and I'm going with another dealer who offers a fair purchase price on the new RAV4, $10,000 under the original desert toyota price on the exact vehicle, used.    If price is no object- go nuts and visit desert toyota. If you want a fair price, do a cursory internet search and find any other dealer in the state and get a substantially better price.”
- “I returned a lease about 1 year ago and bought a new Corolla from the dealership. About 1 month later, I received a letter saying I owed $300 for what Toyota considered "excess wear & tear". The car was significantly under mileage and had no visible damage. I asked my sales person, Geoffery Batz to look into this since I've never been charged once I turned a lease in and particularly when I buy a new vehicle from the dealer! Apparently they turned this over to one of the finance guys and apparently he dropped the ball since I just received another letter (one year later) supposedly from a debt collector stating I owe the $302.  When I asked the dealership to look into this, they said their's nothing they can do since too much time has gone by. Considering they SCREWED this up, to begin with, now I'm screwed. I will never buy another vehicle from these guys and would encourage anyone else to take their business to another Toyota dealer.”
- “Ya know, I realized I hadn't written a review of this place until a phone call jolted me into correcting that error.  I bought my Corolla at a different Toyota dealer in Tucson.....but when I moved to the Eastside I started bringing it to Desert for service.  The first time I came in for an oil change it was very.....sterile.  I dropped my car off and Kyle, the personal service guy or whatever, tried to convince me I needed to flush my transmission and blah blah blah.....whatever, I just need the oil changed.  I HATE pressured add-ons like that.  Fast forward a couple of years and I start getting phone calls for offers to buy my car because they're short used cars and will offer me x amount to buy it back and put me in a new car.  I told them I wasn't interested.  This happened no less than three more times and I finally said to remove me from their list, I was NOT interested in selling my car. "Did you get the check we sent you for ten thousand dollars?"   Uh, no, stop calling me.  Thanks.  They had the audacity to call me back that same day- someone forgot to put a checkmark next to my name or something.  It's just bad.  Walking onto the lot of a stealership, you know what you're getting into, you're going onto THEIR turf, but when they start calling you?  No bueno.”

## Tips from customers
Never coming back to this place. How come you there are several clerks available and only one is attending people?!?! Displeased. Bring some work or our computer for the free wifi while you wait for your car maintenance...long wait but free wifi and coffee. First time here and the waiting area is huge! New owners clinic! Excellent customer service. I'm surprised by the low ratings I'm in parts Dept desert Toyota guy comes in no mask counter man says no worries? he never wants to go anywhere else to service his toyota, that tells you something that tells you something.  Always personable and great service. they always apply all the coupons without the need to bring it. Complimentary coffee, water and they have a decent snack bar in the waiting area. Wifi is free and fast! Free popcorn, coffee and water as you wait or use their complimentary shuttle to get dropped off and picked up once they're done with your vehicle. Friendly service Never ask for Eddie this guy terrible and so mean shame on him Stay away! They are liars and have no shame about it! Fast, efficient. Raul was super helpful and excellent to work with. Thank you Raul!! These people don't care about you they only care about your money...trust me I worked there. Oh and be careful on test drives since 80% of the sales associates are on some form of drug.

She helped me pick out the engagement ring as well as the two wedding bands that fit the shape of the diamond . If she wasnt the manager id wonder why not . All stars for this location & you may thank her for this .”
- “Cheryl is thee best! She is a manager who has been there a while and has always gone out of her way to help my nana and I. They have layaway plans, accept credit cards, and have one of their own. This is my favorite Kay store, I have been to the one at Park Place and they are just not as pleasant to work with. At Tucson Mall I know I will be taken care of no matter what / who I am shopping for. Every now and then for holidays they have really good steals for stifling silver jewelry.”

- “This place can be hit or miss . On my last visit I was unpleasantly stalked by one of the employees .  I told her that I didn't need any help at the moment and she continued to drill me about purchasing jewelry . I understand that they have a job to do but I made it clear that when I needed her help I would ask for her assistance .   The annoyance of having a pesky employee breathing down my neck made me seek jewelry else where . RELAX Kay jeweler employees ! Some customers don't like an abrasive sale person that uses bulldog tactics to hustle over priced jewelry .”

We took the ring to Kay's store (#765) ((Tucson mall)) to be looked at and that is where things started to go bad.  We were offered a refund or repair per our warranty. (((great!!!)))  We were told that the ring fell apart due to the fact that the diamonds were "too small" and that they would keep falling out "most likely!"   (((((  but that's a ring Kay Jewelers sells and stands stand behind?????? ))))))) ((( not so great!!! )))  My thought was to go ahead and get a refund due to being told the ring would "most likely" fall apart (lose diamonds) and you only have 30days for a refund.  I still wanted the same ring so I could have got a full refund purchased a new ring and warranty and have had a new 30 day policy with a new ring.  when i told this to whom I believe to be Myra Graudet. the female sales rep from Kay's with salt and pepper hair (whom I believe to be Myra Graudet) then stated that since the ring fell apart within the first 30days that if the ring needed service or the ring broke again  Kay's would still offer a service or refund of my choice, if the ring fell apart within 30day of having the ring back from repairs, because the normal refund policy is 30days. ______________________________________________________________ (((( !!!!!!she agreed!!!!! )))) that it would make sense to get a refund now then purchase a new ring and 30day policy due to the rings falling apart "a-lot."  she then told me it would take more time to order the new ring and size the ring and it would be quicker to have the ring repaired and that kay's would give us another 30days on that ring. so i wouldn't have to wait for a new ring and then if something did happen within 30days again she assured me I would have the option of service or refund of my choice within 30 of receiving the ring from repairs.

- “Went in to Kay Jewelers at the Tucson Mall on May, 11th for their "supposed" 35 percent off deal to buy our wedding bands. I chose mine, and he chose his. After all was said and done, Meghan became disinterested after she made her sale, and felt she no longer needed to help us. We had to ask numerous questions, regarding sizing, ESP plan, date of arrival, etc as she felt it was our job to ask and figure it out. After we left, we noticed that my fiances ring did not get the 35 percent off, only the online price of 30 percent off. He should have paid 363.53, instead he was charged 391.30, which was the internet price of 30 percent off, not 35 percent. We called and asked for Meghan, told her that we were not given the 35 percent off of his ring, and her response was, Nothing i can do about it. When you come to get the rings we will have to see if we can do anything. Went in on May 26th to pick up rings, and my ring was a CHEAP PIECE OF SHIT TIN MADE IN INDIA. They didnt think I saw the tag on it and it was removed quickly. I did not get to see this ring in person and with most rings we were interested in, they did NOT have in the store, so we were forced to order online without seeing the rings in person. My fiances ring was perfect, however, mine was a piece of shit that was DROPPED by the sales people Meghan and Cheryl on the counter and the floor 3 different times. Then the issue of the 35 percent came up. They started to say oh, that was a in store deal only, and u were misinformed. We said not our problem, we were never told and we want the additional 5 percent given back to our account. They himed and haued around, we dont know if we can do that, blah, blah, blah. Needless to say after not accepting the bullshit, they were able to credit the 5 percent difference to our account. However, they became heavily confused, papers and receipts all over and neither seemed to know a damn thing about what to do. I will NEVER shop at this store ever again. I could have sent my ring back and told them i didnt want it, but they would have wanted to do a huge rigamaroe, so on, so forth. The other thing is I ordered a size 9, they sent me a size 8 and 3 quarters ring. Then you watch both the manager and the salesperson argue about who is right and who is wrong about the size. They did not order what i asked for, they took it upon themselves to order whatever in the hell they wanted to. If my wedding wasnt coming soon, i would have gave the ring back. Lesson learned not to shop at Kay Jewelers at Tucson Mall. I also want to say it is very misleading to the customer when u see something online you cant see it in the store and so when the customer gets what they ordered like I did, then you get royally screwed like I did. Customer service is NOT number 1 priority at this store as both Meghan and Cherl as soon as they got the sale, they wanted nothing else to do with us, unless we wanted spend another 300.00 to get their bullshit 100.00 reward certificate. We have already WASTED 1400.00 on this bullshit. Horrible service, misleading, and junk this store sells. Never again, and i will have to buy a different ring later on down the road definitely somewhere else. This store should close down like the rest of the stores in Tucson Mall. Horribly pissed off.”

- “Very nice dealership they took the time to show me the car that I wanted explained financial options even though my credit wasn't so hot and came up with a solution so I can get my dream truck. Really had a great experience here”
- “I was recently looking at Dependable Auto's 2011 Kia Sorento to replace the existing family vehicle.  I was looking for something clean, spacious and decently priced.  After a month of shopping around southern, Arizona, Dependable appeared to have the best vehicle and price.  I arrived and was immediately greeted by Tony who was very helpful and provided a pressure free opportunity to examine the car, take it for a good test drive and answer all my questions.  He offered an opportunity to take the vehicle to the families mechanic for a thorough unbiased inspection.  After a week of deliberating I decided to make an offer on the car.  The dealership owner Hardan gave us a great price on the truck and agreed to address some minor issues with the vehicle at no extra cost.    There was some miscommunication at first the day the vehicle maintenance was scheduled to take place but both Jessica and Hardan took care of things and ensured I had my vehicle back the same day.  When I contacted Hardan (Owner) via email, he replied in just minutes and followed up with several phone calls.  The only thing I'm still waiting on are the vehicle plates and registration.  That being said although I've only owned the Kia Sorento for a couple of weeks if the vehicle proves to be as good as the service we received, you can consider me a very happy customer.  At this time I will highly recommend Dependable Auto Sales.”
- “Hardan, John and everyone else at DAS are AMAZING PEOPLE! I went in as a first-time buyer and was met with open arms, great advice and a diligent team willing to work with me and the financial dept. to get me the best possible price. I left Dependable Auto Sales with a beautiful Cadillac for a VERY low price. I will definitely recommend to everyone I know and I'm truly blessed to have been able to find them”

- “I would do everything in your power to run away from this dishonest, lowlife, family run business as they are all crooks and liars.  If you want a company that will make deals with you and completely deny them once finance is all set and, then they are you people,  if you want good honest service, go anywhere else and youll do much better  had my financing set and a check in hand and they pulled a bait and switch on me. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!”
- “Buying a car at Dependable Auto Sales was the worst choice of my life. I bought a Chevrolet Uplander and the shop's owners told me that it was a great working car. I trusted them and I spent almost $7000. After less than two months, the car's transmission - a fundamental piece of the car - broke down with no apparent reason. They couldn't explain me why and I finally had to pay almost $2000 to fix it. I'll give one star because I can't give zero.”
- “Very poor service when you buy a used car it should have a spare tire but not this one and the tell you oh sorry we get our cars from auctions so you're on your own to get a spare tire. Very rude people.”

For starters this company is 100 % HONEST, 100%  KNOWLEDGEABLE  from the techs to the office Manager Jay.    Our family couldn't be more happier to give this review to CONTINENTAL AC and HEATING TUCSON and to JAY  the Manager.   Plain and Simply put,  they are the BEST in our opinions and we've been through the RIP OFF companies LIKE SO MANY OTHERS HAVE, but never again now that we've found the BEST.   Thank you so much Jay and CONTINENTAL A/C & HEATING/  TUSCON  for providing outstanding A + SERVICE AND 100% SATISFACTION.    Sincerely,  Barbara, Jewel, Robert”
- “I called Continental to come out an give me an estimate to replace my ac unit. Jay came and was very helpful. He seemed knowledgeable and honest. Jay gave me a good deal and they were able to install it the same day. I strongly recommend this company as their prices are affordable and they provide excellent  service. AAAAAAA+++++++.”

- “Extremely poor customer service, I purchased a Mini-Split system from Jay, He didn't register my system with Fujitsu, and will not return my calls for service for a defective system. Run from this company!”
- “I needed a duct installation, they had me waiting for 2 months giving me HOPES that they will show up soon, I try calling the office and this Jay person who acted as the "owner" at first, then when I wanted to share my complaint and get some answers he said he was not the owner, long story short they never showed up, not even a courtesy call saying they won't be able to do the work. I chose them because they made the AC installation 2 years ago I guess it would be easier.”
- “I called this place a few weeks ago because my air conditioner condenser motor was not working anymore. They sent someone out, who was late. Their time table was "sometime before 5pm". They told me this at 8am. I waited all day and once the guy came (after 5pm) he said he didn't have the part and wouldn't until the next day at 8am. He didn't show up until well into the afternoon and mind you, its Arizona in August and we had no working AC. He changed out the part and was finished. Charging us over $700 for the part and labor. Not even two weeks went by and it stopped working again plus it had blown a fuse. I called them back to have someone come take a look. I called for 12 hours and no answer. Once I got an answer, the man said they would send someone out and no one ever came or called me. By that point I had called a different much more reliable company and they came and took very good care of us and were prompt and didn't rob us. Turns out the condenser motor we needed was a $60 part and they charged me over $700 for it and didn't even care that it stopped working. Please do NOT use this company! They are scammers and thieves! You're better off finding a more accredited and trustworthy company. I wish I could get my $700 back.”

- “This staff has worked hard to overcome many challenges to improve the property. For anyone who has ever worked in customer service or management I feel that social media is being abused by disgruntled people who don't like to play by the rules.”
- “Lovely and very well maintained apartments! Great location; close to all! Really comfortable and inviting environment. Feel safe. Management highly responsive to work order needs, handling them expeditiously. Grounds beautiful and well maintained.”
- “As the management I would like to share recent photos of the property. I feel that we work hard to resolve resident issues. Please contact us directly if you have concerns so we can make your home a great place to live.”

- “Worst property I have ever rented from. We have had multiple issues that have not been addressed by management. The rent is over priced for the area and the complex is full of illegal activity and unsafe residents. The police are on property multiple times a week and everything about this place is a nightmare. When I moved into my unit it was infested with cockroaches. The residents are loud and children run around unsupervised vandalizing the grounds. My air conditioning has been off for TWO WEEKS and I am repeatedly told by staff it will be fixed and it has still not been attended to. The laundry rooms are broken and infested with bed bugs and the whole community is very unkempt. The hot water goes out at least once a month. It is UNSAFE, DIRTY and downright unpleasant. Please do your research before renting from them. I seriously regret signing a year lease.”
- “Honestly, I don't even live here but my roommate and I checked this place out when we were apartment hunting.  The women helping us was rude to tenants right in front of us.  She tried explain how the security and pet deposited work but the numbers didn't add up.  Our whole 30 minute experience there just had bad vibes.  After showing us the apartment, when it was becoming obvious that we weren't interested, this lady just kept talking and talking almost as if to keep us from leaving.  I don't know what it's like to be a resident there, but just being a guest was uncomfortable.”
- “If you can afford to go anywhere else GO! Go somewhere where they actually care and respect you. Go somewhere where there's more than one entrance and exit. Go somewhere where they actually do a decent preparation for you to move in and not do things to cover up what the last occupants destroyed or ruined. Go somewhere where when you request for maintenance they actually come and you don't have to put in several requests for the same thing. They are quick to put notices on your door but the trash will stay piled high for DAYS! They have an entire plan for us to move our cars so they can re-pave but don't have a planned place for our cars. Ready to tow our stuff so quick though. The staff before was very helpful and since the change it's like they don't respect us at all or even care what's going on they just want us to help them put up a facade for the next occupant. And last but not least ROACHES ! Even if you don't have them the neighbor will gladly share theirs with you. My advice if you do move here, get them to come spray every week, plan your next move and thug it out until then...”

## Tips from customers
Love The bad review is absolutely not true. Please come and see the place i call home. The office folk are wonder ful as
Are the maintenance team.  That bad review was probably some one who got turn down for an apt and for a good reason .  thank you tiki mom

- “Just got to come home and tell my 8 and 12 year old sons that their weekend plans have changed because Auction Tucson gave the pool we won to someone else. I have referred so many people to this site- I can no longer do that. Do not recommend.”
- “0 stars. Had I read any of this I would NEVER let these Thieves handle my items. Mike Cummings And is little helper James are lying sacks of crap. They took my items, made a bunch of promises, that were heard by several others, and sold my stuff for less that 1/4 of its value. they promised me they would not let it go for pennies on the dollar. they would pull items and give them back to me to sell on my own or re-auction the items to insure better value. It took many phone calls and being blown off many times to fond out they robed me blind. I received a $5,000 check for $40,000 worth of items, . and before they come on here and try to point fingers at me, I have witnesses and a signed contract that they in fact violated. THEY stated the escalation and throwing me out of the shop and refused to return my items that did not sell. They are thieves, Liars and cheats.........BTW most of the positive posts are either employees, Family members or relations.”

- “Started our night very unimpressed at eden and decided to catch an Uber to Curves . We were pleasantly greeted and seated by Dillion upon entry . There was no cover charge + my wife and I received wrist bands for 2 for 1 drinks !   Pros - good music ,lots of stages , most of the dancers/servers are friendly, a wide selection of ladies for every taste, dancers didn't seem to be on drugs , the price of a private dance was great , my Wife felt very comfortable there , the restrooms are clean   Cons- no complaints”
- “You would think fancy, upscale places like this one are on the pricey side. But you can make your experience at Curves reasonably affordable if you do it right. First of all, there's no cover before 6pm or after midnight. If you really want to go in between those hours you can always rip out an ad from the Tucson Weekly, the local alt newspaper and use it to get in for free, if you don't mind walking up to the bouncer with a greasy pennysaver. That's what the kids these days call a "life hack."  Plus the drink specials are really good. Every day wells and draft beer are two-for-one up till 7pm. The regular pours on draft are $7 for a 10oz so you're essentially getting 20oz for the same price. And cans/bottles are $4.50 during that same time.   But the main draw here is the food. The prices are fantastic. The regular menu has burgers and a side of fries for $4.50. And the size of the burgers were pretty good. The price goes up a dollar if you get a fancier one. But the entrees are all under ten bucks! And that doesn't even include the 50 cent wings. There's no limit on how many of those you can get! The wings were a bit on the small side but at that price you can get twice as many as your normal order and fill up.   Be aware that they don't do tabs at the bar so you either have to pay with cash or they charge $20 on your card per transaction and give you the cash difference back.   There are also some excellent food deals on top of all this. Every Friday during the day they have 99 cent burgers and after midnight on Fridays and Saturdays they have a free taco bar. How can you beat free late night tacos on weekends? I was overall very impressed with this place. This may be my new favorite restaurant in town!   Yep. Can't think of anything else to say about this regular degular restaurant. Just a normal place to come and have lunch and a drink while your wife is at home with the kids and she thinks you're at work.”

- “Girls steer clear, I came across this post of one of the apparent owners, it's disgusting. If you're a traveling dancer like myself, do not bother with this place. We already deal with enough bs.”
- “please don't go here the management is racist and pressures girls into doing sexual activity with them to keep their jobs. One of the owners names is Bob and he's a racist who makes this club very unsafe for the dancers. As a dancer myself i would never feel comfortable working here the girls deserve so much better. I'm lucky enough to have found out about this from other dancers before working or just going here in general.”
- “If you haven't been to this place yet, don't even bother. It's low class with outdated decor. Even though there's enough space to dance inside the building this is not allowed, you will be asked to leave if you don't remain seated. The chairs look old and appear to be covered in semen, which is visible under the black lights. The cocktails are watered down and mostly consist of ice, that's kind of ridiculous for $9 a pop if you ask me. Once again this is the last spot in Tucson you would drag your friends, family, coworkers, or even a first date.”

## Tips from customers
Good place nice girls and clean table dance is also at a great price Two-for-one Wells & Draft beers before 7pm. No cover before 6pm. 99 cent burgers on Fridays. No cover after midnight.

- “Today I was extremely impressed with Public Storage and more so the manager, Estelle who helped me. I came in to pay for a unit and I was grateful for Estelle's friendly personality. She answered all my questions thoroughly and was extremely helpful during my visit. She and the other staff I've interacted with at Public Storage deserve the highest accolades and gratitude. Great job! I will be a Public Storage renter for years to come.”
- “I was desperate on several occasions for different reasons and needed various sizes at the last minute.  Ayisha, specifically,  ALWAYS has a pleasant attitude,  is EXTREMELY KNOWLEDGEABLE of product and services.   I appreciate seeing her when I'm moving.  She's am amazing entrepreneur... positive,  and a challenge solver.”
- “This location is awesome.  Jennifer was courteous, professional and extremely helpful.  I reserved a unit for our staging business and could not be happier.  The facility is nice, safe and very clean.  Kudos to Jennifer, I would most definitely recommend this location.”

- “For the last week I have had difficulty accessing equipment I keep on site here for work due to the negligence of the staff to keep up on their 'DegiGate System' that controls all the doors and gates. It's caused me to be: 1) locked in waiting for somebody to let me out making me 20 mins late to my next meeting.  2) locked my equipment inside rendering me unable to work for the day on certain jobs because I am unable to access my equipment.  I highly doubt they're going to fix this because it seems to be an ongoing issue they refuse to invest money to fix it or something. Completely unprofessional.”
- “While the exuberant customer service representatives on the phone were pleasant, the actual in-person staff at this facility are less than accommodating.  The billing for the unit is aggressively pursued, even to the point of asking for the next month's rent fifteen or more days early.  If you are foolish enough to sign up for automatic renewal they will draw on your credit card using the same time frame. They have a large dumpster on site that serves no purpose since they guard the access to it as if it were Fort Knox.  What, pray tell, do they need a dumpster for if customers are forbidden to use it?  The toilets are consistently filthy; I have seen cleaner in many third world countries I have visited. To top it off, the doors of the unit require a special lock which you MUST buy from the management and is completely useless for any other purpose.  There are so many other storage options in Tucson, and I only wish I had investigated them prior to doing business with these faceless corporate pirates.”
- “I called Public Storage in Tucson and reserved a climate controlled unit at this location. When I arrived, with the truck I had just driven alone from NC to Tucson that was full of furniture, I was told I did not reserve climate controlled. The two ladies in the office-Aysha and I'm not sure the other one's name that was there at the time-acted like they had no idea of anything at all or what went wrong. They offered to let me take a unit twice as large (much larger than I needed), at twice the price.   I drove to the other location to speak in person with the person who I had spoken with on the phone to make the reservation. Even though we had said climate controlled multiple times, I thought perhaps he had made a mistake on the reservation and could help me out. (Other than offering me that unit at twice the price or a unit too small for my stuff, this location wouldn't offer anything.)   When I arrived, he said he remembered me and double checked my reservation...confirming, as I thought, that it was for climate controlled. When he called the Houghton location, they told him that when my reservation was made, they came back with another customer who wanted a climate controlled unit and gave her mine. At that time, they changed my reservation.  So not only did they  1. Give away a unit for which I had a confirmed reservation, but they also 2. Changed my reservation without notifying me.  3. Lied to me about my reservation and pretended they knew nothing when both of them were clearly perfectly aware of what they had done. 4. Offered nothing but to make me pay double for a year's worth of storage to pay them for lying to me and taking away my reservation.   Honestly, to the poster below, if you were the end of this May, it makes me wonder if my reserved unit is the one that suddenly became available. I did not arrive outside of my reservation window (came in the same day it was made) and didn't cancel it or do anything that would have made it available, but it was given to another customer.”

- “jason and his crew at landshapes recently finished some work for my husband and myself to help update and beautify the area around our home. we couldn't be happier with the results.  the work was done with great care for detail and efficiency. the site was left orderly after each day's work. these guys were very hard workers.  any questions we had were answered promptly and fully so that we all were on the same page during the process.  the final outcome is amazing.  i celebrate the transformation i had hoped for and would surely use them again.”
- “I had Arizona LandShapes install an irrigation system and some plants to my front and back yards.  They listened and understood what I was looking for and provided a detailed proposal for a good price.  The work was good quality and efficient and they helped solve a problem with a tree I had that came up.  They were also responsive to my follow up calls to help me understand how the system worked.  I had good communications throughout with Jason and his crew and would not hesitate to recommend them.”
- “Jason worked with us last year to create a beautiful yard from nothing in a timely manner.  He referred us to a landscape architect that helped us design a plan that incorporated our existing plants as well as future plantings. He was able to repurpose bricks and make a beautiful outdoor living room. He poured a new cement patio and gave us two curved seating areas.  This was all done in time for a family reunion we had planned.  Jason gave us great advice on how to continue to build our backyard retreat.  We now have planters with vegetables, and my fruit trees and lilacs that were doing poorly where I had planted them are thriving.  His crew comes monthly to tidy up.  Just today he responded immediately when I damaged the irrigation system and helped get it up and running before anything died.  I have attached before, after, and a year later pictures that don't do it justice!!”

- “This is the worst company you could ever deal with.  Jason did not ever work full days.  I don't know how his crew to.erated this. Took over 2 weeks to do a simple 3 day job. Then when he was close to finishing the Flagstone walk, which he obviously underbid, had to leave early to go to another job. Had to run to Home Depot every hour to get more Flagstone and concrete.  Obviously did not know what he was doing. Left  ours in an obviously untenable position from a longevity standpoint. I had it totally  replaced today by a reputable contractor who tore out the crap Jason tried to install , and put in the most beautiful walkway and patio addition anyone would be proud to have. He should stick to being a certified Arborist, but then??? This work was done at my Arizona home in 2015.”
- “If there was a NO star selection I would definitely select that option. This company is the most unprofessional company I have ever used. The fees are cheap and the quality of work is even cheaper. Stay away from this company at all costs. They are not a company that can be trusted at all. Horrible horrible experience!!!!!!”
- “I am so sorry I hired this company.  I got a quote for some simple yard clean up and installation of a gas grill.  First warning sign -  I was charged for someone to come to my home to give me a quote.  Next warning sign - the workers didn't show up when scheduled.  I was contacted about a week later and was re-scheduled.  The workers came, did the work and much to me surprise when the invoice arrived it was double what I was quoted!  The workers grossly overstated the hours worked.  Then I was lied to - I live in a gated community and was told that the gate was contacted to verify entry hours.  The gate house does not record any entry hours.  I negotiated a settlement on the invoice and grudgingly paid.  My recommendation would be to not hire this company but if you do, don't make the same mistakes I did and get the quote in writing!”

The couple of workers there are always upbeat and very pleasant I know Larry and didn't catch the name of the the woman who's station is in the extreme left! So uplifting to see Post Office workers that r not grumpy and makes r day! Thank you! Your job must not be easy!”
- “What a great post office!  Everyone here was cheerful and chatty with all the customers entering and waiting.  The line moved quickly and I doubt I was there even 5 minutes.  I was, yet again, mailing dirty clothes home from my trip to Arizona.  I almost always bring 'some' packing supplies, but need to pick up a Priority box.  Got everything in that medium flat rate box.  The postal clerk helping me was funny and made this a good experience. You could tell this team actually enjoys working for the usps.  Other post offices could learn from them!”
- “I never thought I would give 5 stars to a post office; especially near Christmas. Having been burned by another station on Valencia, I decided to drive a little further to this station. It was December 16 and I arrived with my packages a little after 9:00 am. I needed a couple of shipping items to complete my packing. I was pleasantly surprised to find them just inside the door, unlike the other post office where they are buried in the corner just before getting to the counter. This made it convenient to have all my packages ready when I got to the counter. My next pleasant surprise was that, even though I was there during the Christmas crush, there were only about 5 people in line and the clerks were moving them through very efficiently. The staff was also very friendly and actually showed some pride in their job. I will definitely drive a little further to this post office for my future postal needs.”

- “Silverbell post office I Would give you zero stars here's why:  I have had quite a bit of issues with this post office telling me inaccurate things both when I'm there in person and to people who have had to help pick up my packages.   They've sent back a very expensive package  to sender because they said I didn't pickup in time. They sent it back they say I tried to pick up and they would not put a hold on it to prevent it's delivery return to the sender.  Another time they said they were holding my mail for a month and then when I went to get it said they sent it all back to the senders. They told me I'd have to call my banks and basically everyone because return to sender mail initiates a process by which then the sender thinks they don't have a correct address on file for you. I was aghast...I asked the woman to please check again and she gave me the same Run around. Thank God I went back a few days later before all those calls and I asked a different attendant who managed to find every bit of my mail for that month! I'm like Seriously?! It's a chaotic mess in there and it seems like no one really knows what they're doing or the proper rules. They have given my friends helping a very hard time too.   Once I myself went to pickup a package they left a slip for and they only gave me one of the two of my packages in their possession. Then they wanted to keep the pickup card which was for the 2nd package actually, the one they didn't give me. Good thing I requested to keep it because I went home a looked up the tracking numbers and it said it was at the post office and to arrange a delivery. Well they don't deliver heavy packages over 25 lbs or something like that they told me so I had to go back and get the second package, which was the one linked to the pick up card they tried to take. I mean straight negligence.   We've always had to take it up with a supervisor and I was very close to filing an online complaint which can definitely be done in this case. I'm sorry they are so difficult! If you're not getting a reasonable answer I recommend talking to the supervisor's supervisor.”
- “It gets better.  Days after the Silverbell Post Office carrier declared my package "delivered", I got the vendor to send me a duplicate shipment.  The vendor notified me that UPS (which had successfully transported the package across country) had handed it off to the Silverbell Post Office, so I went down there to get it.  The counter clerk walked back to the package section and came up front with... THE FIRST PACKAGE.  The one that the carrier had declared as 'delivered to front office/reception/mail room" had been sitting on a rack at the Post Office the whole time.  I then had to go back two days later to get the second package because they couldn't find it when they handed me first first package.  A total FUBAR all around... and neither package was ever scanned into my Informed Delivery.  Silverbell Post Office is *not* to be trusted.”
- “Just don't go here.  No automated machine for self service, so even if all you need is to stamp a large envelope, you have to wait in line.  And that line--it's what all the bureaucratic  jokes have based their punchlines on.  Twice now, I've spent 15 minutes in line without moving.  Literally--15 minutes with two employees serving two customers.  And the Post Office wonders why they can't get things right?!  Just leave this place alone.  Hopefully it will help get the thing closed so that we can save an extra penny per year in taxes.  Yikes!”

## Tips from customers
Difficult to use the outside mailboxes unless you're driving south. Hours are 9am-5pm and they're closed Saturday and Sunday. Location lost my package and they didn't really do anything to help me find it Don't get in Mary's line if your in a hurry the lady never shuts up!

- “Placed a big order and all the orange chicken was dried out and semi hard. Just because you keep it overly glazed with with sauce doesn't mean the chicken stays moist and taste, on the contrary, it has a sour taste! However, the teriyaki chicken is great but not worth the cost of getting overly dried out hard orange chicken! Disappointed.”
- “I think I'm going to give up on Panda Express. Every time I go to this location they screw up my order somehow. You'd think I'd learn. I always order online through the app and it's always a big order....$30 or so. I live 20 miles away and keep finding their mistakes AFTER I get home. Yesterday I requested extra soy sauce and instead I got NO soy sauce. These people do not care.”
- “I used to love this Panda. Now, not so much. The portions have gotten way smaller, tonight my chicken was soggy. It's usually never hot. I'm sad because my son loves the place, but bugs in his drink today is the last straw. Went to take a drink, took the lid off, and BUGS flew OUT. some were dead and floating in his Sprite (which is 50-50 you'll actually get Sprite, most of the time its carbonated water).”

Sit down and have some quality Panda Express. Food 5/5

I openly told them what the medication was to stop them from handling the pills. Although, I wasn't willing to tell the why I take it. I told them I would show them it was percribed to me and the reason isn't any of their buissness. I was told by a officer they would have to take the medication and lock it up. I ended up calling for a supervisor and had to jump through hoops including pulling up what medication is typically percribed for via my phone. This seems like a huge hippa violation. Government shouldn't be able to ask why you take medication. Anyways, I was disappointed and didn't feel this was keeping anyone safe or a  reasonable request.”
- “Went to pick up some legal documents. The security there treat you like dogs. I'm not a criminal, but, not even a criminal should be treated with such disrespect. There is a female security guard that barks at you. It's already nerve wracking enough to go there. Why... be a dick?”

## Tips from customers
Go to the bathrooms not on the first floor. They're much cleaner!! The jury assembly room is cramped!! Pack water and a snack, you'll be here awhile. Also remember you can't wear shorts or rubber flip flops. For validated parking rates you have to park in the public garage near the YMCA. Expect to be here for hrs to come if you come without an idea of what paperwork to fill out. The people will just guide you where the "packets" are, but will never tell you more. It's frustrating because you still have to go downstairs and wait to filled. Have an attorney or read on the law before coming down.

- “So, I'm sitting here at work reading a brand new, fresh-off-the-keyboard Yelp review written by my nearest & dearest (and ethereally beautiful) best friend Naomi G. In this review she wittingly chose the verb "polished" to describe her most recent experience devouring a 1/4 lb burger (and accompanied fries). What's funny about this mental image to me, is if you saw her, you'd wonder where she fit it all. I mean, she literally is the quintessential poster child for what a gorgeous petite woman should look like.   What does all this have to do with Peter Piper Pizza, you ask? Well, let me tell you!   A long, long time ago, in a land not so far away (about 500 miles to be exact), two girls (let's call them Naomi & Rebecca) met up frequently for social outings together. These outings weren't like that of most other girls. They didn't sip on cosmopolitan martinis in some fancy New York sky scraper like Carrie & Miranda. They didn't get pedicures together at some fancy resort. They didn't go to a blow out bar and get their hurr did (Naomi mostly did that solo & Rebecca was too broke at the time). No, these girls were different.   When they went out, they met up at Peter Piper Pizza where together, these two "polished" off a large pepperoni pizza and a basket of buffalo wings. They didn't care about the P.O.S. carousel there or the alluring ski ball games. They didn't care about the child cootie-soaked carpet beneath their feet or the useless waste-of-space plastic prizes. All they cared about was their pizza and the time they got to spend together eating it. By the time they left, Rebecca practically had to be rolled out of the joint, kind of like Violet from Willie Wonka... and Naomi always skipped out with childlike energy....again wondering, where does she fit it all? (Jealous!)   The moral of this story? Well, there's a few. The first is size doesn't matter, unless of course you're a guy, and I'm sad to say you'll be battling that one for the bulk of your life. The second is that no matter where you go, spending time with someone you love can make a 3 star place into a 5 star experience. And lastly, Peter Piper Pizza has some damn yummy pizza!  Thanks for the nostalgia, Naomi. I miss you and our pizza outings. :)”
- “Kathy the manager was reorganizing the pizza at the buffet, which is what my children and I were there for. She said hello RIGHT when we walked through the door. She took my order and had me in my way in no time. The place was practically spotless and clean. All the pizzas I tried were hot and fresh. The entire staff working at that time was friendly and polite. The game area had not one "out of order" game which is always a plus. The man at the redemption area for tickets was patient with my 3 and 5 year olds choosing their prizes. On our way it, the kids decided they wanted another slice and Kathy was very helpful with them and made sure they didn't burn themselves on the hot pizza. I have to say this was by far the best experience I've ever had at a PPP. I will most certainly be back to THIS location. Thank you Kathy! See you next time!”

- “I do not usually complain, but this merretts a response. Once a week we eat your Peter Piper on 22nd.  Love this place until we observer what we can only term anarchy with your employees. We watched mayhem and disregard for customers experience(ours), and disregard for the manager, "Chancey" or somethn close to that spelling. He politely asked for them to do their work as they made obscene gestures at him,  He did not see this but our kids did. Directly after that it got busy but they  ignored his calls for help. A bit later they we using profanity right by our table!  We left. Ruined our dinner.”
- “It would've been a lot less disrespectful to just tell me you didn't have wings... How are these old, overly dry "hot" wings not somebody's idea of a joke?”
- “I normally go to the one on 22nd and old Spanish trail I go there weekly. I made the mistake of ordering from this one the lady on the phone would not let me order the advertised coupon of 12.99 for an 1 topping co pizza . For that reason I do not recomend.”

Ron the pharmacist said he would show me exactly what to get as I would have no idea what to choose from in a sea of medications to choose from. He was very kind to check my existing medication to make sure there was no conflict. What a gem the staff was. Thank you Ron and everyone at the Walmart pharmacy in 22nd and Craycroft, you're very kind and helpful. Exactly what I needed.”

- “Gave me the best rate on my RV loan, I was very grateful”
- “Wetmore branch in Tucson. Denzelle Holguin is amazing. She helped us with an auto re-fi when our other credit union didn't want to get off their a$$es to assist us. She handled it all, start to finish. Super professional and friendly. HIGHLY recommend her and Hughes.”
- “Being a young adult I didn't know which bank to go with I've banked with Wells Fargo for awhile as my first bank, wasn't happy with my banking and always felt like there should be more rewards or benefits to banking. So I made the switch and have enjoyed Hughes ever since plus for first time buyer of a car they give you the lowest rates in town.”

## 1★ samples (Negative Reviews)
- “Worst credit union in Tucson. Too many reasons to list. From authorization and utilization on accounts both personal and banking and loans, to the user feedback and accessibility on the mobile app-   Delayed service, slow service, limited service   ***if time and functionality must be quick easy constant and hassle free- don't expect that with Hughes***   (Local since 1993, first account with Hughes established in 2006)”
- “Your treated as a number not a member , membership has no meaning to them. Have always insisted on using them when I needed financing, as I just did when wanting to trade my car in. Was denied, Even though the two accounts I have with them are in good standing with no late payments. Really was'nt adding a new loan just trading in a car and yes I know it's considered a "New" loan. Very disappointed and when settled will not use them again”
- “I didn't think I'd ever write a negative review for a local business. This is for the entire business, and not a specific branch. I spent 2 hours today trying to get my member number to pay my loan not knowing their online system doesn't accept payments on the weekends! WHAT!? THEN, every branch has the same phone number so you can't actually get though to a real person at a branch. Poor customer service. Poor app services as well because my member number and account number are no where to be found in the app. If I could move my car loan to a different credit union I would.”

## Tips from customers
Fridays they're open until 6. If you're a member bring you loose change here to use the coin machine for free. If you're not a member there is a fee. Very helpful friendly Very helpful

- “I enjoyed my trip to the casino. From the minute I walked in everybody I met were friendly. I was pleased to find out that the benefits offered to veterans are wonderful. So if your a vet get your tribute card. I liked the variety of slot machines.  I had some good payouts. Which enabled me to play for a lengthy time.”
- “Staff here was very friendly and helpful.  Needed to pick up some free tickets for an upcoming cover band concert.  I didn't have my Diamond Club Card with me, but they were happy to issue me a new one quick!”
- “The bar service was fast and friendly and the bartenders make some really great Micheladas at the Sports Bar or the bar next to the blackjack tables. Also, the food at the grill is tasty. I ordered the loaded nachos and their Sonoran hot dog and it was ready within 5 minutes and tasted great. I don't gamble, so I cannot comment on that, but I like visiting the bars over there and eating the food. I haven't been disappointed yet.  This is a review only for the one on Pima Mine Road in Sahuarita, as I have not been to the one on Nogales highway.”

- “We decided to try the buffet  for the second time because the seafood buffet  on Fridays was not too much to brag about. I know that this isn't  Vegas but for $15.99 per person one would expect something  decent. The food is terrible  and tasteless The salad bar had a variety  of wilted greens and old vegetables, and the dressings  were watered down. The prime rib was sub standard full of grisly fat and full of veins but it did have a distinctive  taste of salt. I was afraid to try the pork and county ham because I'm sure it was left over from past buffets besides they were probably cold like the imitation  prime beef. The other selections  of edibles, chicken,meatloaf,a tasteless shrimp dish and the other usual fair one would find in a Army mess tent was not even worth the trouble to try it. Steam tables  are a foods worse enemies .Bad food for the money. The food gods were on my side though  because  afterwards  I hit a nice jackpot on the slots so our buffet  that was disappointing  was covered  by my winning. ..Lousy food should be free and that's  was I got.”
- “After telling friends about my Thanksgiving dining experience at Desert Diamond Casino in Sahuarita, Which turned out awful. I should email and tell you about it. I went for Thanksgiving dinner - There was NO Thanksgiving meal. No turkey, No dressing, No cranberry sauce, and No pumpkin pie.  Just the your usual Tuesday meal - nothing special. When I go home I was not felling fell. So I slept for about an hour, when I got up I spent the next three hours on the toilet. I should have known better about the food, it was room temperature. It made me sick (where were the food police). The worst part of this was it was my 70 Birthday. So much for celebrating!”
- “This review is only for the buffet.  Came in for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon and the buffet theme was chinese food.... I was already 95% sure it would taste terrible but of course I couldn't resist trying a little of everything to make sure.   Everything was bland, the "orange chicken" and other meats were dry and nothing came close to tasting like any sort of chinese food. The only thing I actually thought was ok was the salmon.  Not sure how much the buffet was since someone else picked up the bill but it seems pretty cheap (though your money is probably better spent on some fast food). If its chinese food themed, you should avoid going, and if you really must eat here, stick with the salad bar which seems like a safe bet.”

Smokey EMS on the Border today My daddy & I winning big $$$$$ ziggy marley!! Diamond grill is great for a late time snack Its a casino so kids can only go to Events and restaurant Happy Mothers Day!

- “This place is not a very good place to keep loved ones here, staffs are being always being fired and the licenses for building is not being up to date ad I was told by an employee at all  Outlets  sockets are broken in every room, no holiday pay for some reason ..”
- “If I could give this dump zero stars I would. I am an former employee that witnessed the pain, suffering and death of patients that arrive with minor issues leave dead. Call lights of patients take hours to answer. Trach patients that wanted to be weaned were denied services because long term insurance brings in more money. I have seen hospice patients get treated so cruelly it brought tears to my eyes. Workers have been escorted our because they were hysterical having been tested positive for Covid 19. No one had been fitted for an N95. They use non disposable PPE gowns. 1/2 the staff has or has had the virus. If your loved one are here, please get them out before they perish.”
- “DO NOT USE THIS FACILITY! I hate that I can't give this zero stars. My grandmother is experiencing punishment for asking for the care she is there for. The staff has taken her phone, her call button, shut her door completely and left her with no way to contact anyone. She asks for food or drinks and doesnt get it for hours, even a simple glass of cold water or coffee in the morning. She is sitting with wounds unchanged and burning, calling repeatedly for change. Same with bathroom calls, she's sitting on dirty pads and in her own filth for hours. This place is completely unacceptable, they are mean, angry, lacking in empathy, and obviously don't care about their work because it's not like this place is bustling, and the patients are not cared for effectively. Any review source you look at, this place has majority bad reviews. Believe them.”

If I'm in a rush and don't want the interior cleaned, I love that I can go through the car wash myself and I enjoy the experience. I really love that they have hand dryers at the end of the wash to dry my car off for me in addition to the blow dryer, such a nice touch! They are speedy, friendly and do an awesome job every time I bring my car in!”
- “The team was fast efficient, the intake service rep kept his mask in place and made it easy make payment.  My car had a lot of dog hair from a one hour ride with my shedding canine -friend. The service representative made the disclosures they could not promise to get everything off of the seats and carpets.  However, when I retrieved my car, it was clean as though it were brand new!  The Mister Car Wash - East Speedway team was great!”
- “They did a great job. Chase, a new employee was very nice, wanted to please and did a real good job vacuuming. The older gentlemen, whose name I do not remember, also wanted to please and got some dried bugs off, when he was wiping off the car. The manager, I believe his name was Sean came over to make sure I was satisfied. I would recommend this Simoniz.”

I asked some guy in a "blue" shirt if my $19.00 dollars included vacuuming and he said "yes". Then I showed him my backseat and he was a deer in headlights. Nevertheless, they ended up vacuuming my backseat but I had to wait another 15 minutes.   The net result and advice to anyone reading this review, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AT THIS PLACE!”
- “Went here for a car wash And when I came back they stole all the quarters from my car thinking I wouldn't notice. The wash they did on my car was not good either, for 20 bucks they should at least wipe down my dash...lots of dust still.”
- “I took my vehicle here for a basic wash. They damaged my vehicle by wiping my dash with some sort of chemical that shouldn't had been used... perhaps bleach? My dash and doors are now extremely discolored. Don't go here if you want to leave the car wash without any damage to your vehicle!”

## Tips from customers
this location will be closed from 3/24 to 4/30 for renovations. but I love this car wash so I'm sad!! Get the rain x service. Free Veterans Day car wash and discounted detailing. Still have staff that will towel dry. Makes car less spotty compared to blow dry no touch any day No free vacuums at this location They got rid of the bunny! :-( But they now serve complimentary popcorn and coffee in the lobby. All car wash places give you a 24 hour rewash if it rains. Not here!!FYI Car got scratched badly! Brand new 2016 Nissan Altima I can't even remember the last time I washed my car. With monsoon season over, it is time.

The staff helping me to the back were wonderful.  When I finally met Dr.Wang and his assistant Vanessa they were very kind and helpful for my situation.  Dr.Wang is very knowledgeable and knows what he is doing.  He makes sure the patient is receiving the right care safely.  This office is clean and well kept.  Staff members provide excellent customer service and Dr.Wang is a kind doctor.  Highly recommended! 5 stars earned!”
- “My five stars are for this brilliant doctor McColgin.  She cares.  She is honest.  She is friendly.  She helps nervous patients to relax.  I was petrified of the surgery.  I did not want anyone to ever have to fool with my eyes.  I would take my mother to Dr. McColgin and I truly loved my mother. The staff at the Campbell office is very friendly and helpful.  Vanessa, Amanda, and Monica assisted me with contacting my ride and I have low blood sugar; Monica went to their refrigerator and brought me a protein drink so that I would not get sick.  I am willing to do a commercial for Dr. McColgin and not get paid.  She is a Godsend.  I truly believe that God orchestrated that I would find out who she is through Dr. Iveson who referred me to Dr. W. Lynch who referred me to Dr. McColgin.  What qualified doctors and such a blessing to have these doctors in my life.    God bless Dr. McColgin and all of her staff and fellow-colleagues. I am recommending her to all of my friends and lovedones who are in need of eye care and surgery.”

- “Run as far away as you can from this place. The Drs. may be good but the staff should be fired.  I live in Sierra Vista and had to get someone to drive me 4 times for cornea replacement surgery. The next week they gave me four more appointments without checking my schedule. When I said I couldn't make it they rescheduled me for August but apparently didn't cancel the schedule they had already made. I had someone drive me up for an appointment only to find out from the Dr that I didn't need to be there. It cost me $45 to get a service to drive me there for nothing.  The following week I got paperwork for surgery the next day. Too late to schedule a ride and besides we had cancelled this one. I was told I had to get another covid test and they will not let me get it done here. I have to drive to Tucson.  Now, they have totally cancelled my surgery in their words, "until I get my act together." All because they are too lazy to schedule my covid test here and because they will not admit that they have made several scheduling mistakes.”
- “What a terrible place. My wonderful eye doctor at Barnet Dulaney referred me here because he wanted a test done that required equipment he didn't have. His receptionist made the appointment for me and I overheard her describe in detail the test I needed. Imagine my surprise when I showed up for my appointment to discover that the office they sent me too had barely any equipment at all and that I would need a second appointment at the other office to get the actual test. This appointment was a complete waste of time. The office was set up so I overheard all the consultations with other patients and the staff were mind bogglingly incompetent when they weren't on their phones. Stay well away.”
- “I called requesting a callback from the dr regarding numerous incorrect billing invoices...never heard back. My insurance card literally has the co-pay written on it, yet they try to charge me triple. In addition, my insurance company tried to assist them with correcting the billing error on the end of Cornea Associates, yet, guess what.... they continue to make the same errors time after time.  On top of that, they wanted to charge me well over the co-pay, and proceeded to state if they charged me incorrectly, they would issue me a refund.... pretty sure that's not how that works. I'll be going back to Primary Eye Care... much more competent. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!”

Very inconvenient, and should at least be posted online on the website not when we arrive. It places an immediate burden on everyone because we think it's open but it's not. And god bless the employees, is there really only one employee in the whole store? So 3 atat employees in all of Tucson? Shame.”

When I asked her how I go about getting my problem solved she told me she didn't know. I asked her to please call someone in her company and ask about it. She didn't want to help and I had to ask her again to place a call. She finally agreed and found the information. When I thanked her, she gave the "teen aged eye roll" then started playing with her phone again.

- “Had a very great experience with Garret (I believe was his name).  I came in for a battery, and he matched the prices I would get at Costco, was very nice and put in the battery for me and he didn't have to, I was going to just do it myself.  Very industrious college student and Sears should make sure he is the manager before long, if he isn't already!”
- “I had a great experience here! Tire/auto shops are normally gross places from the appearance of the staff and the shop and waiting area. Sears is rewriting the book on that! The waiting area was great! Even the repair shop bays were tidy and well kept. They gave me a time frame and were dead on!  I came here only because I did not want to take my small child to a shop type atmosphere. They are never safe or comfortable. Here we were able to walk around the mall get a bite to eat and hang out at the play ground in the mall and wait for my car.  I only had a screw taken out of my tire but I'll be back!”

- “Terrible customer service. Dropped a car off in the morning only to be told after I called them four hours later to see about my car that I was told. That it wouldn't be ready because the part was delivered to the wrong store and my car would need to sit overnight. Incredibly poor customer relation skills. Told me that "things happen" so get over it. I wouldn't recommend that anyone take their car to people who can't bother to do their job and check on things. An embarrassment to the industry to say the least. If I could give them negative stars I would. Tucson Mall location in particular.”
- “I was told they would call me when the car was done. They estimated it would be 1.5 hours. After 2 hours I came back, in which the representative told me it was done, they did not call me. After informing me of this he told me to wait a minute while he took care of something else. He took an additional 5 minutes on his computer and another 15 minutes on the phone calling a customer to inform them about what he could do for his car. My transaction would have taken less than 2 minutes while he charged me, but this guy made me wait almost 20 minutes for his phone call. His name is Jose. And I would recommend he take a course in customer service. If he at least acknowledged me or asked me to have a seat instead of waiting for him 20 minutes there would have been a much different review written.  By the way Jose after his call shuffled me off to another representative to cash me out.”
- “We bought our tires here at Tucson mall sears due to ease and convenience of dropping off car and then just shopping during the hour or so while having tires rotated....but it has always been a nightmare checking in.  Usually only one person both manning the phones and also trying to get cars checked in.  Today was my last straw.  Waited 25 minutes. JUST TO CHECK IN THE CAR.   They are almost never done when they say they will be.   We won't be returning ever and will be buying our stuff at discount tire or elsewhere. This is much too frustrating  I only give one star because they staff is very friendly usually”

- “It is so nice to have a new, clean, modern looking DQ. Service was great!! It was busy and crowded but they were friendly and quick. They got my order exactly right.  Everything was fresh and very tasty. Best banana split ever. Took out the Chocolate and added Carmel.   I look forward to coming back often.   Welcome to our neighborhood!!!!!”

- “Always had a great experience  here at this location. The staff is also very friendly and helpful. Called and asked about ice cream cake selections and after telling me their current options, they also said they can make a custom blizzard cake if order in advance. Yummm!”

- “I am so sad, we have been to this Dairy Queen so many times over the years I got a cheesecake blizzard blended to the point of vanilla ice cream with a hint of cheesecake. I'm bummed after spending $25 on, ice cream with a hint of a flavor we paid extra for to get double of is just a sad waste of my paycheck.”
- “Tonight was my first experience at this Dairy Queen location and I was extremely disappointed. I ordered a cookie dough blizzard, in a waffle cone with extra cookie dough. I was looking forward to vanilla ice cream with chunks of cookie dough, and was left with ice cream that had been blended so much it turned into chocolate with a couple bites of cookie dough.”
- “This is the place to be if you have 15 minutes to wait for an unmixed blizzard!  These employees don't have a clue :(  the "chickens running around without their heads" syndrome. I mean really, how hard is it to screw up ice cream????   Head to Broadway/Sarnoff--they rock! We will drive the extra time to get great service!”

## Tips from customers
Its just a normal Arizona Dairy Queen:( 
no food just ice cream.

- “I had a problem with the factory electrical plug on my hitch, so I went to U-Haul on Speedway for help. It was a Sunday, so I didn't expect much, but it turned out they had a technician there. He tested my harness, and instead of selling me a new one, found a blown fuse. Fixed it for free!    I was needing a brake controller, so he walked me through the different choices, sold me the parts I needed (they were the same price as Walmart), and even found and pointed out where to plug the harness into the truck. Took me all of 10 minutes to install it at home.  These guys are extremely helpful, and the price is just as good or better than Camping World or Walmart on what I needed.   Save me huge amounts of time, did it with a smile, cost was at or below their competitors, and on a Sunday. That's as above and beyond as it gets in my book.”
- “Kevin was awesome! Great customer service. I highly recommend this location for all your moving needs.”
- “Both the employee assisting me to make the initial reservation and later change it were congenial and efficient. I don't have a computer so I had to call to change the reservation. It was found immediately.”

- “We use U-haul a lot recently. Moving a business from California to Arizona has been stressful to say the least. The U-haul store on Speedway has been great to work with until this morning. Kevin (last name withheld). Was extremely rude with my wife upon returning the truck. Not only was he not wearing a mask, but he was very aggressive about the returned status of the vehicle. I could give you a list of the state of the vehicle upon pickup but it's a rental moving truck. It gets used and used. But that's beside the point. We return all of the rentals in better condition than we received. I didn't realize that we needed to provide photographic evidence of the condition. Kevin in his role of checking in trucks was quite aggressive and rude with my wife. She came to me in our vehicle to ask me to assist her and was emotionally charge after dealing with Kevin. I proceeded to get out of my car and asked Kevin what the problem was. He started in on me. I am sure that Kevin is a problem. He wanted to strong arm us into paying for cleaning the truck. One green leaf left in it. Let me tell you that the Uhaul guys blow it out with a leaf blower and nothing in the cab is cleaned or sanitized. Footprints left on the window. Dirty dirty dirty. Kevin must have been taking out his frustrations on his customers because he did the same to the customers who returned before us. All of our previous experiences with the other employees has been exceptional.”
- “CROOKS WORK HERE! Prior to rental, everything went good. After the return is when I got screwed. I put 21 miles on the truck for a local move, also put $14 of gas in it, which put the gas gauge just above compared when I picked the truck up.  My bill was suppose to be around $90, I got charge over $180.  The bill said I returned it with less then a quarter of a tank of gas, which is also not possible since I only put 21 miles on the tank. I have photos to prove it, photos show milage, time returned and gas gauge level. They still won't refund me the over charge.”
- “I visited to get a quote upon leaving my car bottomed out on their horribly paved driveway entering speedway leaving theur property this cost me over 400 bux to fix as it broke my tranny mounts and snapped the head stud off my exhaust port, videos on youtube my car is stock aircooled vw beetle no lowering etc do not visit here less you want a costly repair bill as they do not maintain their drive!!!”

## Tips from customers
Get yo' hitches installed here. Will accept unopened returns, including boxes! We returned our truck the same day we rented it, but if you rent on Sunday and need extra time, the due time is 7 AM on Monday morning for the same rate.

- “The crews where at my home so quickly! I had no idea services like this existed and I'm grateful this one was so knowledgeable. I loved all of the managers and crew, but hope to not have to see them ever again.”
- “We worked with Aaron to remodel our bathroom back to life after a faulty toilet flange leak that ruined the upstairs bathroom and laundry ceiling. The process was not as stressful as I had anticipated. Also, I loved that I was able to personalize and buy my own materials for the project. All the contractors we worked with during this project were super respectful to keeping my house as clean as possible, completely the job quickly and efficiently. I would definitely recommend this company for all of my restoration needs. Thank you for making our house a home again.”
- “I had a ceiling leak in my walk in closet. The insurance adjuster said he was 97% sure that they would cover the repair. Mario of Abracadabra came out and did the lead/asbestos testing and sealed up the closet. George of Abracadabra kept in touch with me every step of the way.The test came back positive for asbestos. The insurance company took 2 1/2 months to give me an determination on my claim. They denied the full claim.  Abracadabra was kind enough to charge me only for the testing and not for the dehumidifier fan. and sealing of the closet. I would not hesitate to call the again if I had any kind of emergency. My closet is one now usable.”

- “Had these guys come out to clean up some water damage. As they were moving my furniture around they broke a mirror of mine. I was told they would take care of the damages by paying for a replacement. After several attempts to call have a check mailed to me I still have not received a thing. Every time I call they tell me they need a few more days. It has now been 3 weeks and have not received any repayment for my broken item.”
- “It all started out so well. Frankly, we expected that if there were going to be any issues it would be with the insurance company, not Abracadabra.  When our upstairs neighbor's bathroom started leaking into our bathrooms, we called Abracadabra after reading positive reviews on Yelp and other sites. They came out quickly and did a hard-sell on beginning the work right away. As in, within the hour. Not wanting to sign a contract until we got the go-ahead from the insurance company, we declined. A whole lot of "this is a level 3 blah blah blah certain death" type lecture later, we still declined. Luckily, our insurance company very quickly approved, and work began right away.  The driers. Oh, the driers. So, so loud. Eventually we had no use of our bathrooms because Abracadabra claimed there was asbestos in the walls, so we had to go to a hotel, but assured us we could be back in our home in about three days. When I read the reviews, there was much ado made of the care they took of belongings and furnishings. They left an antique runner in the hallway and they walked all over it and rolled dirty, heavy equipment on it. Didn't pick it up. When I documented the marks on the rug, they asked me for it, to clean themselves. I asked them if they had a person they used to clean antique rugs. No- they were going to do it themselves.  Hahahahahahahahaha. No.  They would come every few days, do one or two things, then disappear again. If I wasn't at the house, I wasn't getting updates. Once we moved into the hotel, work slowed considerably. Then stopped. Finally, after repeated contact with our job supervisor, we started slowly getting some work done.  I rarely saw the same workers twice. I don't think I'm underestimating when I say I saw at least a dozen strangers in my home at various times. One worker made a racist joke about all the Mexicans at my house (was flabbergasted; did not respond). I would be told that one area was ready, only to inspect it and find that paint had been spattered on the wooden blinds, the shower head was off-center, as was the toilet. Our glass shower door was tweaked to where it wouldn't close completely.  And that was just the work. Abracadabra was calling and billing me and my boyfriend separately no matter how many times we gave them our preferred phone number to reach us, and the party to address all billing to. Bills were never itemized, just a total. It took so, so many requests to get itemized billing. Double-charged for a couple items. They threatened to send our account to a collection agency WHILE STILL WORKING ON THE HOUSE. The right hand doesn't have a clue as to what the left hand is doing at Abracadabra.  Remember that three day turnaround? We lived in a hotel room with a kid and a dog for about a month.”
- “DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. THEIR WORKERS WILL ROB YOU BLIND. My cousins insurance had them come out to replace asbestos after water damage. After reporting missing items the FIRST time, the company told them that they had trusted guys on the job but they would talk to the crew anyway. After that, all of their critical life paperwork was stolen (SS cards, birth certificates, marriage certificates, etc.) They again reported the theft and were told the company would remove the crew and replace them. The company either LIED about doing this, did not change the lock box code or have zero trustworthy employees as they were robbed a THIRD time. Finally they told the company they were not allowed in the house without an appointment.   Now the company has finished the job and about one week later their front door was kicked at 2:00pm and the few valuable items worth taking left were stolen.   Their house is in a nice area, neighbors have never had any of these issues and are the sweetest new family you could ever meet. We know the first three incidents were Abracadabra and the fourth likely was too. No one else would risk a robbery like that in the middle of the day without knowing what they wanted.   DO NOT USE THEM UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.”

Can't even get them to return a call.....called them 3 times

- “We have had the best experience there because of Kelly! Kelly has been kind and very very patient. When we weren't happy with the way something looked in our home, she made it easy to find something we loved! We love the quality of the furniture we bought and intend to make all of our future purchases at La-Z-Boy. Their quality and customer service are top notch! Go in and ask for Kelly, she's really great!”
- “Kellie, our sales person, and Jen, our designer are an awesome team! They took the time to get to know us and our tastes. We found the selection and design program to be the best experience we've ever had in selecting new furniture. We had an entire new home to furnish and they made the whole experience fun and painless. We were a bit overwhelmed at first. The design program and the ladies' expertise took all of that away. We cannot wait to take delivery and enjoy the beauty and comfort of our beautifully furnished new home.”

- “The delivery boy, I can't call him adult because he has a brain of a P size. Didn't think I was looking and he was throwing my brand new La-Z-Boy that I just purchased three days ago around in The bed of the truck. Who is he to throw my property around. But of course through my years of experience I have learned that if it happens to me then it happens to other people that he did for whatever reason. Otherwise everything else is OK. The price and the merchandise, and the salesmanship on the floor. I hope  his boss will read this and have a little talk with that young man, because like I said if it happened to me it's happened to other customers without them knowing it.”
- “Not Good! In October of last year we purchased 2 chairs from Lazy Boy!  In January of this year I noticed the foot stool on my chair started pilling, large threads hanging out.  One of their service people came out and told me this was usual and he proceeded to shave these threads with a fabric shaver.  I do not believe that this should happen in only three months when we paid $700 for chair.  Also the seat on my husband's chair is already starting to sink in and of course this is also usual.  So in others words "just live with it." Not happy at all.  $ 1200 For chairs and we should just live with it.  Never again!!!!”
- “Summary: Sales experience was great but the follow-ups and inaccurate information given to the customer changed this 5 star review to a 1 star review.  We came in to browse for furniture ideas and ended up using their free interior design services. We worked with Mimi and Jen. At our initial visit, we picked out the couches, chairs, and some fabric swatches for upholstery and pillows.   We then set up a time for Mimi and Jen to visit our house to take measurements and present their ideas for a color scheme based on what we picked out in store. I highly recommend doing this since lighting in the store and your home can vary as well as it's nice to see the colors with your painted walls and flooring.   A week after the in-home appointment, they present to you a computerized design to scale of your room. This is the appointment where you finalize your purchase.  At no point during the process did we feel pressured to buy everything they offered. Mimi and Jen were respectable of our budget. They said delivery would be in 6-8 weeks and Mimi would call 2-3 weeks for an update. We put 50% down and would make the second payment when the items were ready to be delivered.  Up until that point I would have rated 5 stars.  I waited 4 weeks and gave them a call. It turns out, 2 of our pieces would be delayed until August since they were a new collection. I have a toddler so we can't really wait that long for a tv stand. I was upset that I had to call to find out about the delay. Shouldn't I have received a call a week earlier? I appreciate that they let me use a loaner console table and that they delivered the rest of their order - this is after I had said to cancel the console table and end table orders as I needed to buy from somewhere else that had them ASAP.  We paid the remaining balance and were assured we wouldn't owe anything when the 2 other pieces ship out in August. We receive the remainder of our order in August. Everything went smoothly!  Up until this point, I would have given 4 stars since they let me use a loaner and were very apologetic with the lack of follow up. I wasn't mad about the delay - I was upset no one told me about it and I had to be the one to call.  Fast forward to 8/28/19 and I get a call from Mimi about $1,100 remaining balance. I told her per our conversation in May when I made my second payment, she told me everything had been taken care of. She told me she would look into it.  I didn't get another call until 9/16/19. I figured they had remedied the situation. Long story short, she sent invoices that show the remaining balance owed. We'll pay but it is just really upsetting about the incompetence. We were told the balance was taken care of and have made financial decisions these past 4 months without taking into account we still owe $1100.   At 35 weeks pregnant, this whole experience has been very stressful. This was our first time buying quality furniture. I thought the customer service would have been better.  We had an upstairs loft we were excited to furnish with a leather couch and recliner so my husband could have his football room (lol). After this experience, we will be shopping elsewhere.”

It's nice to have the online ordering that shows exactly where they are at in the process, ie making the pizza, and when they have left to deliver the pizza. Drivers have always been very courteous and professional.”
- “These guys amazed me, ordered from California for my wife that would be checking in nearby at a local hotel and thought that was it. Not only did their driver Benjamin call me as he was pulling up to deliver the pizza ,( I happened to be in the phone with my wife at the time) he was very polite and downright helpful at an otherwise stressful situation. Thank you Benjamin !!! 5 stars!!”

- “I'm a regular Domino's customer and my family has always had the tradition of ordering every Friday from our local franchise in Santa Monica, CA.   As I moved to Tucson, AZ a few weeks back with a friend of mine to study at the university, I wanted to continue my family's tradition.   I opened the Domino's app, logged in at 8:00 pm and proceeded to create my carryout order. By 8:05 my order was in and an employee from store #7621 was prepping.   About 20 minutes later, I figured it was time to go and I received the notification my order was ready for pickup. About five minutes later we arrived at the store and the monitor had one order, "James - Ready For Pick Up," now 8:30 pm. The only employee who seemed to be working didn't acknowledge us for ten minutes as we seated ourselves.   At 8:45, I got up from my seat and asked him when my order would be ready and he proceeded to respond, "soon."   Now 9:00 pm, he finishes our last item and as he goes to box it, he drops it on the ground. When we see this we tell him wed like 3/4 items as we've waited over an hour. He responds, "that wasn't your order, I'm putting yours in soon."   At 9:27 pm we are finally handed our 4 items, and the employee said, "here, see ya later," i was quite astonished at this point and didn't even want to eat at Domino's after this experience. we were very disappointed with the service provided at this location. This dominos franchise deserves to be temporary closed until their management and staff are retrained to Domino's standards.   0 Stars If Possible”
- “Extremely rude employees.. you just lost a customer for life!! Extremely disappointed.. I will make sure to tell everyone I know not to buy pizza at this location!!!”

The staff was helpful, not pushy, and seemed very honest.  We've not had any trouble since it's installation!  The mobile app is easy to use to check on my house, as well as to turn on/off the system.  I'm happy!”
- “I have had an alarm with connect since 2013. The service technician Sean is always a pleasure to deal with and truly knows what he is doing. The last time he came out to my house he showed me how to set the alarm by using my amazon echo. I would definitely recommend.”
- “We love our system. We are so glad we went with Capital Connect.They did such a great job installing our system. Jeremy was very professional, trained us on the system and was a pleasure to work with. Our contact Walk has been such a patient pleasure to work with. This is the system we will have forever. We are renting right now and to know they worked with us on  rental meant so much to us. We are exited to have this system next year when we buy a house! Thanks Capital Connect you all are awesome thanks for keeping us safe.”

- “I live in Saint Petersburg, FL and I recently had a capital connect  rep. Come to my house to sell me a doorbell camera, outside camera, security panel and smart thermostate. The Rep never told me that they would be running my credit for the system and all he said was he didn't know when I called him out on it. My appointment was set for Monday 10/1 as I told him is I wanted it installed before I left to go out of town. The technician comes to my house on Monday  but only has one piece of the equipment. He then proceeds to tell me he will have to run to the distributor to retrieve the rest of the equipment.....2 hours later he tells me that he can be back on 10/2 and install the rest of the equipment at 2pm. Fast forward to 2:15pm on 10/2 and it turns to "I'm stuck on a job right now, I'll be done soon and come right over". That never was done and at that point I asked the customer service to cancel the entire order because I do not believe this system will keep my family safe. Later that evening the customer loyalty people called me to try to keep my business. The promised the following: 1. 2 free months of service for the inconvience 2. They would be able to install the complete system by Saturday 10/6 (after completely trashing the other technician and telling me all the problems he has caused). Fast forward to 10/6, at this point no one has called to make an appointment on Saturday with me, I have missed my sons basketball game and daughters softball game because my girlfriend and myself are home waiting for the technician. My mom was scheduled to have their new tech come to her house (which is 3 minutes from my house) between 1-2pm because they told my mom that's the only availability he had. The    New tech shows up at my mothers house to install the new panel as well as new security cameras. No keep in mind, this company told my mom this guy was one of the best techs they had (this comes into play later in the story). I get a call from my mom basically stating that the tech had all my equipment, except the doorbell camera. At this point my entire Saturday is washed.  I decide to pop over to my mothers house to see how the install is going as this guy was supposed to come to my house after my moms. I get there and it looks like a normal scene but something seems off. My mom is visibly frustrated and I sit and observe. My new born niece is at the house and the tech is just setting off alarms. Why is this process taking so long? I asked myself. Well come to find out, this company just hired this man the day before, he worked with another security company previously and the only training he received on this system was an hour dvd on installs. This job was only supposed to take a hour at my moms and is instead taking three because the tech is on the phone with the rep going by a step by step. I sent the rep a message and kindly stated "I understand none of this is any of your fault, but if my entire system can not be installed today, I will kindly asked to cancel the entire order." All he stated was "I understand and ok". I am absolutely not happy with anything in this process. Oh and the biggest part was, the previous tech never installed motion sensors in the house. I set the alarm to away and had my girlfriend walk through the house and nothing tripped.  Now I have been gone out of town for a 4 days on business travel and my family has been home in an unsecured house. That is not acceptable and it is hard to believe that brinks let this company associate their name with such a larger company.”
- “Be aware their service is horrible all your windows and your doors lose the sensors all the time your system goes offline every 10 to 15 minutes the notification that they're supposed to send it to you at the door you will get a notification after you open the door and you are inside the house. Their service is horrible be aware don't do business with them I learned the hard way”
- “Genuinely slimy sales techniques targeting the elderly.  Fraud.   My legally blind mother in Sun City was targeted by 'nice young fellows' who came to her door saying they were from the alarm company and were there to 'update' her equipment.  She was led to believe that they were from the company who's sign was in her front yard.  They pulled out the old equipment, installed new equipment, and asked her to sign papers and give her a cheque so they could process there upgrades.  As they left, they pulled up her old company's sign and put up a Capital Connect sign. Of all companies to provide your home with security WHY would you ever hire a dishonest one.  Do yourself a favor and avoid trusting a company that is not trustworthy.”

- “CLEANLINESS AT A HIGH STANDARD. This Marriott location is by far one of the best in AZ. I travel often but I ONLY stay here when I'm In Tucson. They renovated recently and looks great a but even more the way that they clean is greater. I'm ALWAYS treated like royalty when I am here. I specially love the front desk personal as they have always been very Tucson FRIENDLY.”
- “The NICEST most helpful staff I have ever experienced!! The valet was so patient when i took an hour to unload my car (not really but it felt like that) the front desk was more than helpful when I had many requests (2 beds, extra extra bedding, breakfast questions, etc..) they did everything they could to make my travels alone with kids easier! Thanks for being so friendly in this world that seems to have generally lost its manners!! Great job night staff!! (Stayed just before NYE)”
- “Wonderful stay; clean room and helpful staff. I almost didn't stay here after reading some of the YELP reviews about the hotel not being updated. Our room was #521 and it was pristine.  The carpet looked new and so did the linens. We were here 4 days.  Nice breakfast buffet.    I can't imagine a nicer stay and a better location. It is 1 block to University St which is full of breweries, restaurants and shops. There is a self parking garage right next to the Marriott; free parking on weekends. There is a CVS next door which has a mini grocery section with a nice selection of comfort foods, beer, wine, etc. Starbucks is 1 block away and Wildcat Laundry Co is 2 blocks away, which came in handy half way thru our vacation. (Self service or wash & fold service).  Gentle Ben's Brewery has great atmosphere and food --- only 1/2 block away.   Her is a tip: Join Marriott Rewards free guest program and your room wifi will be free at most of their hotels, including this location. Of course, if you are already a member, just give them your member number when you make your reservation.   We stay at a lot of hotels; I am critical of room odors/smoking odors.  Our room was "like new"with absolutely no odors. Super room and friendly staff. Stay at this Marriott!”

- “I stay at Marriott properties all the time.  As a Platnum Premier Elite member of Marriott Rewards I consider myself fairly well versed in Marriott properties.  The staff is very poor.  I got a bed that felt like two tacos pushed next to each other, I could sleep in one hole or the other.  The bathroom had 6 stainless steel bars - and felt like a poor mans Best Western.  The TV was on absolute lock down - even though they have ports to connect your electronic devices to the TV.  When I told the front desk I was going to check out early, they didn't even bother to ask why and I was so disappointed with this property that I just didn't bother to tell them all the problems that they have.  The single glowing star was the staff in the concierge lounge, very attentive and kind...of course I have to sleep in my room, not the lounge.  I'm checking out of this 'full-service' hotel to stay in the Fairfield near the airport.  I've stayed there before and that has a great room.”
- “I am a Marriott Rewards Gold member and my wife is Platinum. I stayed here with my wife who was on business and we both found this to be one of the worst of the full service Marriott hotels we have ever been at.  Housekeeping was poor - there was a 9v battery on the floor for 4 days - never cleaned or picked up. The heat did not work (We froze the first night). the TV did not work for 3 days and wireless did not work for 1 - We had to call maintenance every day! The wireless makes you log in every time your shut off your smartphone - annoying. The concierge room has the worst food of any Marriott either of us have stayed at.  If you do not HAVE to stay in this area (near the U), I recommend anywhere else. I stayed at the Courtyard Williams Centre before and it was infinitely better, even with the short drive involved.”
- “Checked in with not so friendly front desk.   Went to our room and it smelled of strong animals urine and food crumbs on the floor.  Toilet had not been flushed.  They moved us to another room.... Never been to a Marriott this bad.”

## Tips from customers
It is right downtown on the midst off businesses. For over night if you're just here for a quick trip it's fine.  Definitely not for a vacation. crashin a christmas party! Decent hotel, the internet is horrible though Make sure to ask about discounts. Know that this is a very popular place for people with business at the UA, and athletic teams. Extremely lame the lazy river closes at 9, this is AZ. Should be open later. Best location next to campus but not a clean hotel. Looks exactly like the Marriott Madison West in Wisconsin. After a 1 year hiatus, the Marriott brand name is back on this property, thankfully. The water features have now been removed from the lobby and renovations are taking place. Best lodging if you want to be closest to campus. Welcoming a convention client! Guest suite is a good size. Room is tidy and smells clean - no stale smoke odors. Pool is well maintained. Carpets pass the white sock test (that's where my kids run around like nuts with white socks on). Service has been great. Fred Pryor Excel Seminar This place is now Marriott branded again, and is called the Tucson Marriott University Park Hotel.  They have removed the water features from the lobby and are in the process of remodeling. Blif you have a group bigger than 6 they'll ask you to leave because you're "too loud" but in reality the design of the building amplifies all sounds. Never ever stay here. I have been waiting 2 hours for my room. 

First I was told one hour

Second time they can not give me a room because they let so many people check out late

Third your room is I. Priority clean but there are 3 or 4 in front of you. 

I am one of Marriott's Tony stay folks each and every year also.  I hold meetings and stay about 120 nights each year and this is how they treat you here

I should have known better as this full service Marriott was cheapest in town Nice. Would stay here at my rate  but when school starts... Pricey Christmas party! Concierge lounge has best croissants I've ever had at a Marriott. No free Internet!!! Don't stay here...you will be sorry!! Definitely request a room that faces northeast and is on a higher floor. You will have a nice view of the mountains and campus. Not mariott anymore but still really nice!

The one time I did go in there between sweeping the floor and loud talking on top of 9.00 for a sub that was poorly created, It made me look at subway in a completely negative way. They got this award sign on the window that says they are the Best Subway in Arizona, If Thats the best they can do. Start Over CupCake  !!”

- “Great! Thanks for easy my mind about my coverage for my car rental. It only takes one bad driver to hit you while you are on vacation to spoil a day at the beach.  So glad to hear I am covered by my own insurance and that I don't have to purchase it from my rental car agency at 10X the amount with State Farm.  Yep!”
- “I have known Betty Anne in a personal & professional capacity for twenty years.  She moved her agency from Florida several years back in the hopes of serving her clients in Tucson, Arizona more fully (e.g., homeowners' insurance is no longer offered by State Farm in Florida).   After her relocation, I have worked closely Betty and her team members Lydia & Silvia to help them find ways to serve customers more compassionately and completely in a very challenging economy and confusing marketplace for consumers.   Living these values,, Betty Anne and her team helped me understand a very complicated business life insurance policy I put in place to secure my future, even though my agent is in Florida where I live and not in Arizona! They always go above and beyond, and do everything they can to take care of customers in the best way possible.”

## 1★ samples (Negative Reviews)
- “After being with Betty Ann 16+ years, the past 2 years has been the worst. These agents will be quick and correct to add anything to your policy. If you decide to make any cancellations they can't file correct paperwork to save a life, after multiple filing errors and multiple letters sent with incorrect information, I was done. The unfortunate part to this is that they could care less about your loyal business. Never had received a phone call asking why we were canceling. After the girl at the front desk was rude when I called to end my policy that confirmed I did the right thing. There are so many other insurance agents (cheaper) who will serve your family needs and save you a headache.”
- “If it were possible to give the agency a negative star review I would. To begin I transferred to this agency form another state. In the process of transferring my 3 policies I find out that Betty Anne instead of transferringmy accounts, she establish me as a brand new customer. This caused my rates to sky-rocket as I did not have tenure with the company and this impacted my overall underwritingexposure. Secondly, when I attempted to contact her multiple times regarding this issue she would pass the buck and say it was my problem for not following up. Finally, when I cancelled by policies she stated that I owed over $100 when I paid every month I had her and paid on time. I have still been dealing with this past due balance for 6 months now to no avail. Each time I call her she seems to never "be in the office" and her receptionist promises a phone call back from her which I never get. I have spent multiple hours in her office attempting to resolve this issue, again to no avail. If I can prevent anyone from having to know the same frustration and inconveniece of dealing with this agency's incompetence I would. Stay away from this office and go to an agent who knows what they are doing.”
- “BettyAnne took over my entire extended family's accounts when our previous agent retired.  Car insurance, life insurance, home owners insurance and even renters insurance.  For several years things seemed to run smoothly.  Then in late 2012 it was as if all hell broke loose at BettyAnne's office!   My parents had their homeowners insurance cancelled because BettyAnne misfiled some paperwork.  Less then a month after my parents figured out that their insurance was cancelled and thought they fixed it with the office they got a call from a collections agency.  All of this because BettyAnne didn't do her paperwork properly!   Then my brother had a refund check sent to the wrong address.  He requested that they reissue the check and send it to his address (which they had on file!).  Their suggestion - try and go get it from the address they sent it to.  Seriously?!?  You made a mistake, resend the check to the correct address!  The straw that broke the camels back was when I learned that after having moved back to Arizona and switching over my license, registration and insurance in late 2011 - BettyAnne's office never told the state that I had valid insurance thru them.  (There is a form they need to fax or mail in).  I received a letter informing me my registration had been revoked due to not having insurance.  THEN WHY WAS I PAYING STATE FARM EVERY MONTH?!?    BettyAnne confirmed I had insurance the entire time and then had a slew of excuses when I spoke with her, including trying to blame the mailman. (Who uses a stamp when you can fax?)  She said they would fax over the form to the DMV and my registration would be reinstated within several business days.  Obviously this was unacceptable.  She screwed up and now I can not drive my car for "several business days"?    We like State Farm, but the whole fam-damily moved on over to another agent who actually treats us like a good neighbor!”

I guess this business has a new name which is Clean Freak Car Wash.  I usually stop in once a week if not more.  They provide vacuums so you can vacuum your car after the car wash.”

- “The company's people sold me a monthly car wash and then told me I couldn't go through the wash with my bike racks on my car. I asked them if I could go through with the racks the first time I was there when it was for a free wash. The 2nd time I went to get a free wash I decided to buy their monthly pass. The 3rd visit I had no problem getting my car washed. Today on my 4th visit they said I couldn't get my car washed there with the racks on my car. I asked for my money back for the monthly pass and their employee said "no refund" since I'd already received a car wash with the pass. Bad business!!! I'll be contacting my credit card company to dispute the their charge.”
- “My wife and I just left this place we did not wash our car, there are a few of $3.00 signs all over the place, BIG signs, we got there and asked for their$3.00 carwash, the JERK employee laughed at us and said it's $7.00 not $3.00, his name is Jose, he needs to learn Customer Service, don't make fun of the customers coming into this business to wash their vehicles.  Jose, you are a BIG JERK!!! I will never come back to Clean Freak on Irvington and I 10 in Tucson.”
- “This place is ridiculous. We purchased a $3 express wash, gave the guy a $5 bill, and he says "I don't have any change right now, will give it to you when you come out of the wash". Then we come out and he didn't come to us. So my mom goes to find him, and he says sorry, can't give you your change, I don't have the keys to register. So we waited and he got the manager and they still couldn't give us our change, and my mom was mad as hell. They finally gave us two free wash coupons and we left without our change. What kind of lowlife car wash tries to bilk customers out of a measly 2 dollars!!??”

- “Had to give Banfield another review. My puppy is now 6 months old and is going through a barking phase. She distrusts everyone but us. Marley wouldn't calm down to be weighed, but we were given the suggestion of my husband weighing himself with her, then without. My youngest daughter had an issue with being weighed as a toddler and when we suggested this, the nurse couldn't comprehend it. Sad that people taking care of pets are smarter than people taking care of humans! We hadn't been able to see her vet, Dr. Cameron, for the last few visits. First, she was on vacation, then I kept getting sick and having to reschedule with whoever was available. Marley barked and barked at the nurse but remembered Dr. Cameron! Marley was completely comfortable with her, no barking!  Dr. Cameron understood why Marley isn't well socialized immediately. I was paranoid of exposing her to other dogs, which also means people, until she was fully vaccinated. Now she has all of her shots and we're making baby steps at socializing her. If you see us, don't worry! She's all bark I promise!”
- “We have taken two of our three cats to Banfield and have received excellent, compassionate service from the staff.  Dr. Crawford is a fantastic Vet and it's very clear that he cares about animals.  The prices may seem steep sometimes, but I have never felt that a procedure was conducted that wasn't necessary to diagnosis and treat our cats”
- “All my pets go the the Banfield at the spectrum mall. Thankfully when one of my dogs need to been seen, this location squeezed him in. Very nice and friendly. It's nice to have another place if needed. They are open 7 days which helps also.”

## 1★ samples (Negative Reviews)
- “If I could rate this a 0 star I would.  I have been going to Banfield for several years.  The main reason I stayed with them was price.  If all we needed was vaccinations they were fine, however when our dogs had medical issues they where far from helpful.  Our Sheltie had a stroke (we found out later) yet Banfield told us she was fine, she was just getting older.  Our Chihuahua forms a crust on the tips of her ears so I took her in to have it check out.  After the vet looked at her ears, she left the room.  A few minutes later she came back in the room with a huge book and asked me it the picture looked liked what she had.  I understand doctors don't know everything.....but really....to ask the owner of a pet instead of a co-work.  Our final straw with this clinic was when our chihuahua started bleeding from her bum on a Saturday morning.  I called at 8:20 in the morning and was put on a waiting list.  We went in on Sunday and was told there was a sick dog from their pet hotel and she wasn't going to be seen. Monday also passed with no help.  By Tuesday the bleeding had almost stopped and I had found a new vet that is wonder.  If you are looking for a vet just for vaccinations this place is fine, but if you have a medical issue find a different vet.”
- “$1100 spent over 2 days with no results. Staff members told me contradictory information that led me in circles. I showed up to pick up my cat only to find out he was not taken care of in the 6 hours he was waiting there. Tucson NEEDS MORE VETS because this place sucks and the other 7 places I called were booked for weeks. Shocking incompetence.”
- “Banfield is the worst. Poor pet care and truly wretched customer service. Just attempting to get through to the call center is a nightmare. Do not use this company.”

## Tips from customers
Took two of my pets, cat and dog, to Banfield for their semiannual comprehensive exams. Unfortunately our cat Maynard, a kidney pt., had stopped eating 2 days before the appointment and his lab work was off the charts. Talking with the doctor she told us our cat was in end stage renal failure. To relieve his suffering we decide to euthanize him. The staff was very comforting and caring. We appreciated everything they did and receive our friend had a compassionate end to a full life. They care!

- “The staff at the Canyons at Linda Vista Trail clearly take great pride and have the utmost respect for what they do everyday on behalf of their residents and for the betterment of the community.   Specifically, to say that Mira, Patti, of course Sam, and the rest of Mira's team were absolutely outstanding to our family (including our beloved pet) while we lived at the Canyons over this past year is quite a gross understatement. The management staff went out of their way, as well as above and beyond to make us feel at home during our transition. My children would look forward to obtaining packages in the mail from the main office just to exchange warm greetings, genuine conversation, and sometimes a goodie. We thoroughly enjoyed our time residing at the Canyons.  Scotia Group Management: if you are reading this, your current administration staff deserve raises!”
- “Just signed our lease,and very excited to move in in march these apartments are beautiful as well as the whole complex.”
- “I just moved out here from CA and walked in to take a look at this complex because I was referred by my friend who just recently moved in here. All I can say is WOW! Such a beautiful, clean, and positive ambiance! Emma assisted me and literally told me everything I need to know and more about how amazing this place is. I quickly started the application and the move in process was seamless! Emma went above and beyond to accommodate all needs and checked on me to be sure I was settling in comfortably! The maintenance team are so communicative and friendly as well! I'm extremely grateful and excited to be living here!”

- “I have moved here and my experience has not been the most pleasant... to start off the walls are literally paper thin. I can hear my upstairs neighbors cough (ew!!) in the bathroom every morning, they stomp around all day and our next door neighbor blasts his music and tv a lot and we can hear it from outside and inside SO LOUD. The tenants don't try to change after getting a noise complaint, they also say it's pet friendly but the dog park has pointy cactuses in it (???) your animals could surely get poked and theres no grass/dirt areas for the animals to go to the bathroom. They said the place was cleaned before we moved in but it definitely wasn't. There was someones blood on my door and on a cabinet and the floors were really dirty and some of our appliances were slightly broken but we fixed them ourselves. The people who work here aren't good at responding if you need help, for a situation we've been going through they haven't talked to us in two days even though we need a response shortly. It's just not the best place if you don't like loud people (even if they're not loud you can surely hear them) if you have a dog, or if you get annoyed by other people a lot.”
- “After moving out I was charged 420.00 for what they said was a damaged refrigerator in my daughters apartment. There was no such damage to the refrigerator and after walk through with the Manager she said everything was great. So after them taking my deposit do I now own the fridge? The office knows that the apartment was move in ready when we did the walk through but, they were not going to give me my deposit back. I had previously rented at their other complex here in Oro Valley and they have the greatest staff who are efficient and Professional. I moved back here and I'm glad I did as I would never rent at The Canyons again. I really can't believe they used the: "You damaged a Fridge" to keep my deposit! Also my daughter is of mixed race and I feel that they used this to take advantage of her and I. I would not recommend this Complex!”
- “The management will find any way they can to charge you for something. They charged us a cleaning fee after the apartment was throughly cleaned. They sent photos of fingerprints on the refrigerator and a hair in the bathtub. Save yourself the frustration and do not live in these units. Sketchy businesses practices. Beware. Email me for proof of my claims. I have photos and correspondence from The Canyons.”

## Tips from customers
Update: management came through and the neighbors from hell are gone! Thank you! 1. Run. Fast and far. 

2. If that doesn't work - ask for everything you ever get from the management team to be in writing and pay close attention to every red flag you have - they are all valid. 

3. Ask lots of questions. 

4. Clarify everything you are told with each member of the team in writing - and keep a paper trail. Eventually, you will need it. 

5. Read Mark G's review of this place and then management's bizarre response.  That's their idea of "listening and responding" here.

- “I know what you're thinking when you see "Walmart" and a five-star rating accompanying it.   "But, Jason, Walmart is an enterprise for NASCAR fans and the backyard wrestling crowd. I don't shop with Juggalos and ravers."  And you would be remiss to feel otherwise. Given Walmart's reputation of attracting the most abhorrent crowds mankind has ever encountered, I would totally accept that brand of response wholeheartedly.   This is one Walmart, however, that goes against the grain. Let's commence with the grocery section. It's a relatively compact area that has somehow discovered a way to provide more options, despite the confinement.   The grade of beef sold is second to none. I live in Rita Ranch and will drive the added miles (which is only like two, but still...) for the beef. And that's not even mentioning the chicken, pork, fish, shrimp, sausage and other various fresh flesh items in the meat department. Seriously, don't even bother with any other grocery store when it comes to fresh meat.   Produce is generally stocked with fruits and vegetables you may not be able to locate at other markets on a consistent basis. Mangos, edamame, nopales, habaneros... these are just a select few that I have seen in the produce section at this Walmart when stores such as Fry's and Safeway only have limited availability.   The grocery section is similar to the competition but at a much more appropriate price and while much of the general consensus tend to dislike Walmart's product, the company excels when it comes to groceries and does so at an affordable price-range. Many other grocery chains that are thriving could stand to cut prices and they simply will not do it. For that reason, I will continue to come to this brand-new locale.   The rest of the store is a more spiffy version of most other Walmart's. You can buy anything at a relatively bargain price, but -- for now -- you can do so without any of the Walmart prerequisites that tend to deter the average customer to other competitors. It's like regular Walmart, but clean and with less butt crack. No more gelatinous piles of goo getting in your way here.   I'll return... often.”
- “It's Walmart what can I say.  Found some nice tarps, about 1/2 as expensive as Home Depot.  Yes not really too fun to head to Walmart but yes they do dominate in some pricing on small items.  Some how my kids are always working me for some toys.”
- “This Walmart is extremely nice. It is very clean and organized. The staff are all friendly. It has a great variety of things and in a great neighborhood. The people that go there are also friendly and more upscale than the other Walmart on Houghton.”

- “I gave this Walmart a few dozen tries. It's very close to my home. I finally decided that it's just not worth the brain damage to even darken their doors. Then I forget, I run in for one or two items, and I am quickly reminded. 1 that I don't shop here for a reason 2. the reason is utterly lackluster management and general malaise of product.  (The worker bees seem to do ok.) I wanted a clock radio that could have battery back up. The only two on the shelf had terribly damaged boxes. I was entertaining the thought of buying one if I could see that they had not, in fact, been dropped from a 20 story building.  The manager was notified that I wanted to see her. She walked over the river through the woods, as I was walking out I did find her and decided to pursue the matter, this was after I'd already purchased the other two items. I do have other things to do besides waiting for a 20 something to pull it out. She really could not have cared less. I left her with the radios. I might need to get a tattoo to remind me why I don't go there. I see that I'm in the company of several other one-star reviews. I bet they would be less if it were possible. Target should include them in their marketing budget because they are the number one reason why I shop at Target.”
- “Terrible customer service. They were making fun of a customer after he left. Super unprofessional. Couldn't even do their job.”
- “One of the poorest run stores I have ever been in. Starts in the parking lot with shopping carts in almost ever spot.  When you go inside the staff is hanging out with shelf stocking carts in the middle of the isles. Get to check out to find the price that scans does not match the shelf price.  You would be lucky if the cashier looked you in the eyes as in lifted their head up. All of this is controllable if they cared at all. But they don't.”

## Tips from customers
Don't go to walmart during busy times you might get steam rolled Coachella shopping central Like a clean Walmart? Come here. New, smaller Walmart, so it's significantly cleaner.. & slightly quieter. Not too many of your typical "as seen on peopleofwalmart.com" types. You know you are in Tucson because there is horse parking; they have a hitching post. Don't go to the fabric department if you are in a hurry. There is always a long wait. Newly opened so everything is still clean and organized! Too small to be considered super. Same 'ol miserable employees, including certified stalkers to follow you down every aisle. Inconsistent with store policies one day I'm allowed to return after 10pm with a receipt, a week later I'm denied a return (with receipt @ 9:58 PM). If I can buy something after 10, I should be able to return it after 10.

- “Not much into strip clubs so I didn't expect anything. We were in there for a bit 10 minutes when our party got kicked out (which was alright, whatever) but my main gripe was when I accidentally walked out and forgot my wallet which had ~$220 in it. I walked back in about a minute after I realized I forgot my wallet and I asked to get it back. One of the main guards went and got my wallet for me and as I was on my way home I realized there was about $60 taken out. There's no way to say that they took it because they could just say that I was lying so instead I'm writing this review.

Pros - fully nude , good air conditioning , women's bathroom was clean   Cons - most dancers seemed to be under the influence of addictive substances and very inattentive, pricey dances (double the price of other  clubs ) , small selection of girls , lack of talent , over priced beverages .”

- “I needed tires and an alignment. I went in and talked to about what I needed and they took care of me. Gave me an option for 2 different financing places to help if I wasn't able to pay all of it up front. It was a very nice and easy process, plus they didnt try and up sale or push you to purchase something you didnt want too. They were wonderful!!! Will go back to this one!!!!”
- “Andrew and his crew are the best in Tucson!!! I've been going here for the past year and I can't be happier with the services they have provided. I don't know much about cars other than how to turn them on and how to put fuel in them. I have been talked into so much unnecessary things at other car shops. $1500 here, $1500 there for things that should have been half the price. I went to this location by chance and they have yet to disappoint. Andrew doesn't talk you into anything you don't need. He's straight forward, and honest. I can walk in there, and be comfortable that I'm not going to be overcharged for anything. I know when I leave the job is done right, and I won't have to worry about breaking down 2 days later.   ANDREW!! You are the best! Thank you guys for all the great work!!! I appreciate you!”
- “I always feel they treat me fairly and never taken advantage of. Service is fantastic!”

- “Great at plugging holes in tires, not so much at honoring the big-o road Hazzard warrantee.... had to go to another big-o to get what I paid for”
- “Popped a tire 2 weeks ago. Called everyone within a 10 mile radius and no one had the brand I needed in stock, so I decided to buy two new tires, and this place had the best price... They put on 2 tires that were substantially different in style from what was on there. They were so bulky that it was immediately noticeable and made my car sit up higher on one end... After a lengthy debate with the guy at the desk and some lady that stepped out from a back room, I was forced to pay labor (twice, once on and once off) to take the tires that clearly didn't work on my vehicle back off... Went to Discount Tire like I should have done in the first place. Cost me more money, but at least it was done properly. Even they couldn't believe Big O did such a horrible job.... That I was forced to pay for. After wasting several hours of my time... Tried contacting the corporate office. They apologized and said someone would be in contact. Over a week later- nada.... Stay far away from this place.”
- “Worst customer service I have experience.  I will never EVER even stop foot on the property again.  Horrible place.  LOTS of BETTER options in Tucson.”

- “One of my favorite car dealerships I've been too.  The complex is massive and has EVERYTHING you need.  Everything is clean here, the bathrooms are nice, and there is a fantastic waiting area with a cafe that has plenty of options!  I have had my oil changed twice. Both times it's taken 1hr - 1 1/2hr.  Both occasions they've quote me the appropriate wait time.    They even have a shuttle service to take you to and from work or home while your vehicle is getting serviced.    The technician today went above and beyond by asking if he could fix the "recalls" on my vehicle without me knowing about them.  Ballin!  After Jose did that, he decided to wash my car upon request for free.  Boo yah!  Tires here are incredibly expensive, I'd rather use discount tire, but they claim to price match if the brand is the same...  worth a shot with this kind of hospitality!  What a joy to find a car dealership that aren't total sleezeballs.  The American public appreciates you Holmes Tuttle.”
- “I had the pleasure of quality auto repair and awesome customer service on my last visit! Service Advisor Garrett Hering and Service Director Jason Davis, went the last mile and then some to insure my satisfaction with service performed. I am beyond happy.”
- “Garret and Steve were fantastic! The brake and rear lights went out on our Ford Fusion while being towed by our motor home on our way through Tucson. Once we turned off the ignition, we couldn't get it out of Park. At the end of the day they had to figure out which fuse was keeping it locked up and how to get it out of Park, not your everyday situation. And they did it for free since we would have had to wait until the following week for any further repair. GREAT EXPERIENCE!!”

- “I have had all of the oil changes performed at this dealership since I purchased my vehicle from them about seven years ago - including the two and a half hour oil change done two days ago. After this oil change, for at least the the second time, I found a large puddle of oil on my garage floor the day after an oil change at Holmes Tuttle. Simon the service adviser was rude, short and condescending as he explained to me that it was my fault that the oil plug was stripped and leaking oil. The "rules of physics" clearly explain how it is my fault, according to Simon.   Forty five minutes after I returned the vehicle to the dealership regarding the oil leak, Simon returned my car back to me and explained there was a serious problem and that I should take the car somewhere else and have it diagnosed. I guess that means that Jim Click's mechanics are not skilled enough or perhaps not trained well enough to diagnose and deal with a problem with the oil plug. My oil plug and pan were not dripping a drop of oil prior to the oil change performed at Jim Click's Holmes Tuttle Ford dealership.”
- “I'd like to begin my review by saying my review is for the Sales department. Many reviewers here are voicing their experience with the maintenance/repair services. This review is strictly about Sales. I'd urge you to read this review in its entirety, as I brushed off the negative reviews and decided to try my luck with these guys. Boy did I screw up.   Our experience started out smooth. We were greeted by a salesman shortly after parking. I explained to him exactly what I was looking for and even supplied VIN numbers for the vehicles I was looking for. The salesman went inside and checked their network. He stated the car was at a different dealer who was in their network and would be able to trade the car with one of their own to complete the sale. It was late on a Friday night when we had visited. After being offered bottles of water, my wife and I sat for 30 minute intervals with the salesman running back and forth between the manager to negotiate price. Two hours later, we were signing paperwork on the vehicle and were taken to the finance department where we began discussing our financing options. I was told (on Friday) that the car would be available on Monday afternoon.   Fast forward to Monday afternoon. I took the day off work since I had no car and patiently waited to hear from the salesman. And waited. And waited. Eventually I called him to find out what time I could expect to pick up the vehicle. To my disappointment, he informed me that the car had BEEN SOLD. Are you kidding me? We signed paperwork with a VIN number! "I'm sorry, I didn't find out until Saturday afternoon that it had been sold" he said. The sales department had not called me to inform me of this and as a result, I had lost a day's work of pay and still had no car. I did more research and found other vehicles at Holmes Tuttle using TrueCar, a website that shows what other buyers ended up paying total for similar cars. I downloaded the window sticker to the car I wanted and entered the info. All the options were exactly the same, bringing the MRSP to the same MRSP on the window sticker.   I walk into the dealer and hand our previous salesman our new VIN number. Before bringing us the car I wanted, he shows us a base model Escape and informs us that they can add a sunroof to itt, no problem. No way in hell am I going to get my roof cut open and have a sunroof added.. that just smells like problems a mile away. He pulls the car we requested around. We went back to negotiate price. The MSRP was 33k. The "average price paid" for a car with the exact same features was 27k and I had the paperwork to prove it. Holmes Tuttle Ford is a 'TrueCar certified dealer', which means they are supposed to honor these estimates. In the end, the salesman tells me that before they discuss the TrueCar info, I had to sign a contract saying I would agree to buy the car if the TrueCar estimate was considered. "With everything you guys put me through, I expect to pay at MOST average for this car". Stupidly, I sign the contract. The salesman comes back with a great big smile and says, "Congratulations! The manager agreed to reduce the price by $500!". DAFUQ. We're taken back to the finance department where we are informed that the monthly payments would actually be higher than we were quoted because our interest rates would be different.   All in all, Holmes Tuttle Ford suck. They smile, shoot the shit with you, offer you free water and make jokes and get buddy-buddy with you. But in the end, they WILL screw you. When I go to the dealer, I don't want to make a friend, I want to buy a car. Unfortunately they don't respect their customers and it was obvious that we were jerked around like crazy, only to be given a bullish*t "TrueCar Discount" of $500. Unfortunately, all of the Ford dealers in Tucson (with the exception of Oracle Ford) are owned by the same company and therefore run a monopoly. At the end of this whole ordeal, the salesman hands me the keys and has the audacity to ask me to please give him the highest marks on his customer survey, otherwise his christmas bonus gets deducted.   Bottom line: If you want to make fake friends, go to Holmes Tuttle Ford. If you want to get a decent deal on a car, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.”
- “I bought these Dallas Cowboys tire valve caps a couple weeks back. After taking my car in for an oil change and having them fill my tires with air, I noticed one is now suddenly missing. Looks like someone there also liked them enough to keep as a souvenir. Not the kind of people (thieves) I want working on my car anymore. NEXT!   Hope the valve was worth the loss of a customer.”

## Tips from customers
Ask about any rebates! Ask for Bob Schmidt in sales. BEST experience I've ever had buying a car!! Brake light. Once again, awesome service! Stay away from this place. They are quick to sell you a vehicle, after that, they suddenly have no integrity or morlas.

- “Such a great service! Mobile mammograms. The convenience of a mobile mammogram and a really caring staff makes for the perfect experience.”
- “Our city moved to Assured Imaging on the mobile unit a few years ago for annual mammograms because of the 3D imaging.  This technology identified some questionable lumps in my left breast.  We were able to set an appointment in the office to take a closer look.  Good news is they were benign cysts and 2 subsequent mammograms have determined to be clear.    The staff is friendly and try to make the situation as comfortable as possible. I appreciate their calm demeanor when I was feeling stressed and worried.”

- “19:23 E  Assured I...  4197%  VIEW BUSINESS  My workplace switched to Assured to save a few dollars on our mammograms. Well, the whole switch has turned into a nightmare.  A mammogram is difficult enough, but when you arrive, the drive up facility is in the incorrect location, so the whole world can see you going to get a mammogram. How pleasant is that?  Then the information on the billing was incorrect. Not only was my address incorrect, and I specifically spelled everything phonetically. Then it's even better: I get a bill and never have received one in 15 years, despite having 100% coverage. Problem here, people?  Oh but it gets better! They tell me that they require my prior images to verify what they are seeing on my new images. Then within a week, they say, nope, you need to get in touch with us because you have cancer. Then within the week I get another, telling me I don't have cancer.  Can I tell you: these people are the worst! Don't go there unless you want your life messed with.  Oh yeah...and I keep getting billed. So isn't that pleasant? They can't get anything right.”
- “I'm so fed up with Assured Imaging! A loved one of mine lives in Lake Havasu and unfortunately the city outsources most of their Radiology testing through Assured. When a women needs a diagnostic mammogram the results should not take over 10 days! The wait for results like that is just cruel as the news is not always good.  I have also heard horror stories that Assured has lost people's results and they need to go back for more testing! Havasu please consider someone more timely and competent than Assured Imaging of Tucson!!!”
- “I don't know how their service is but they are lousy tippers to delivery drivers. I've heard from numerous friends that they order for about 5 different people and not one of them leave a tip. Do you go to restaurants on not tip there?? I'm just saying this because I'm watching out for my friends and other people that deliver food to you guys...”

- “Good food, quickly seated in a warm restaurant in a cold day. Good coffee and food was prepared exactly as we requested, extra crispy bacon and hash browns. Exceptional server, Victor. He was polite, listened well, and refilled our drinks over the floor instead in the table. He was kind and friendly but not too friendly. Very professional.”

- “We have used them for several years now, and they continue to provide great service!”
- “Outstanding service -- fast, friendly, and extremely competent. They always call a day ahead to inform us the time they will be arriving, and if they run late, they call immediately to inform us of that (it happens to all of us). We have used them for years, and wouldn't use anyone else -- well worth the money!”
- “They showed up on time, asked pertinent questions and professionally cleaned. I will have them back and recommend them!”

## 1★ samples (Negative Reviews)
- “After 8 years and several incidents that I worked through with this company (floors and kitchen still dirty after cleaning to mention a few) it finally came to an end when they offered a phone bid for a friend's house and then switched from a contract bid price range by an increase of 37% when they decided it was more work than they bid for. The increase reflected a cost per worker by the hour amounting to $39 per worker per hour!!!! I put myself out to refer them but will never recommend them even though the women who came were not culpable for the final severance of our relationship. The management is unreliable.”
- “Disappointed, misled and overpriced.  That sums it up. I scheduled a move out clean and was told that it included everything top to bottom to include walls and scrubbing the kitchen and bathroom floors.  I was quoted $150-$230 and told it could take up to 2-3. Great, I will have a spotless house I thought.   The bathroom was okay as was the kitchen; however, not a wall was touched, a quick mopping counts as floor scrubbing, the ceiling fan in the kitchen was not touched until I mentioned it and they were not able to clean the stove completely because it would take too long.  Now this wasn't brought up until they had been there for an hour and it was after the ladies mentioned that they only had 15 minutes left. Wow. So I told them a partial oven cleaning was fine because they made it clear it would cost me more money and they were short on time. I addressed the fan issue and asked about the walls. They took care of the fan but then I was told it would cost more for the walls and that the owner should just have them repainted. They charged me $207 and left, but not before asking me to take their trash to dumpster  So I called their office to address my concerns and didn't hear back for about 20 (thats twenty) hours. The manager who acted oblivious to my message told me I was wrong and remembered our conversation wrong. I said I felt misled and overcharged to which she reiterated that I was wrong reference was said and that I was charged the correct amount. So I guess the going rate for getting hosed by The Maids is $207.00. Just make sure you're available to clean up after them.   I will contact their national office to resolve this but do yourself a favor and clean your place by yourself or find a different company.”
- “STAY AWAY!!!! In the attempt to surprise my wife to a very clean house after being a care giver to her aging parents, I called the maids.  What a disappointment and a lesson learned.  The floors were already pretty clean to begin with, but found areas that still appeared dirty.    I was mostly disappointed in the fact that my definition of deep cleaning was not met and in all honestly the work was not thorough.  It appeared to me to be a rush job, missing many areas of cleaning from the base boards, to window sills, runners, and on the master bathroom tub.  Furthermore I requested the interior of the refrigerator to be cleaned and once again the job was obviously rushed and not thoroughly cleaned.  The worst part is,  a nasty, dirty white scrub sponge was left inside the vegetable drawer, on top of the vegetables; SIMPLY DISGUSTING!!!  Nobody swept underneath or around the dining room table, a candle stick holder was broken after knocking down a small shelf while dusting.   Finally, it was evident someone opened the closet door in one of the guest rooms  containing important document files.  I purposely rigged a hanger that was placed to show if any tampering was made it was  noticeably breached. As their own policy states that it's not company policy, as we are told, that closets are not usually opened, unless its for vacuuming purposes.   There was no reason to open that closet as it is completely full of clothes from the floor up. This is  something I am very perturbed about given I was told nobody would arbitrary go into a closet.    The fact is, I am sorely disappointed in the lack of service,  integrity being a first (now last time) customer with this company.  Not only that, even after I attempted to reasonably pay for a lesser service provided, I was abruptly told only the guarantee to "re-clean" would be honored.  Spoke to the office manager, (Barb) there was no effort what so ever to work with me on the price. Even afterwards,  I did not feel comfortable about having any more of  their personnel in my house without any of us being at home to supervise. (do you blame me?)  For that, this will be the last time I ever do business with The Maids and will be sure to spread the negative experience I had! As I stated, I am willing to pay a REASONABLE FEE, but for to be charged $280 for this lack of effort is not only a sham, but very POOR BUSINESS!!!!"”

- “Only nail place I trust to put my feet in their spa! Very clean and professional, high quality nail polishes, beautiful n calming atmosphere, best massage chair ... they know how to make their guests pleased and satisfy”
- “The best nail salon experience I've had by far. I called 20 minutes in advance and when we arrived they had two pedicure chairs already prepared for us. The decor is luxurious for the same price as cheaper looking interiors with two wall fountains, quiet wall mounted televisions, and chandeliers. It didn't smell like nail polish but quite the opposite, the peppermint lotion used on our legs smelled heavenly! The chairs had amazing massages, including the butt, which was new to me. The pedicurist got my feet smoother than they've ever been after using the "cheese grater" on my callouses (that's what it looked like to me) and I wasn't the least bit concerned about cuts. In fact she worked delicately around the cuts and burns on my legs without sacrificing any of the massage. She even used hot stones (a first)!  This pedicure definitely inspired me to take better care of myself. Plus, my friend and I stayed in our chairs for probably 30 to 40 minutes past the end of our long pedicures and no one ever rushed us out. To top it all off, they line the soaking baths with plastic and wear plastic gloves when working, so any germaphobe would certainly be comfortable here. Two of these pedicures was only $50!  Quite reasonable for such pampering I think.”
- “amazing! Not only is this salon gorgeous and clean, the owner and the techs are very professional and FRIENDLY. I've been to at least a dozen nail salons in Tucson and chandler, I've grown so tired of the rundown, overpriced and snickering you normally find at salons. I've been to almost all the major nail salons on the Southside and I've never been to a place I actually would recommend. No more! I've already recommended Bella to my friends and family. Bella is officially my new spot, I can stop driving to chandler to get my claws sharpened. I did notice their competitors are posting a few bad reviews here and on Facebook, only because they are afraid of a truly professional salon taking over the Southside!”

- “Went in for a pedicure and sat with my feet in water for nearly 30 minutes before a tech came over. The pedicure was done in about 10 minutes. I asked her not to cut the nail on one of my toes (it's healing from injury) and she kept going back to it multiple times.   The salon is not clean, their supplies are in messy boxes and there are wet towels all over the place. Hated it. Will not be there again.”
- “This place is extremely unorganized. I sat and waited over 30 minutes as they took clients who came in after me, and they don't take appointments. Total waste of my Sunday.”
- “I am not one to leave reviews but this is one of the most uncomfortable and worst experiences I've had in Tucson. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I've been in Tucson for 6 years and will always go back to Classy Nails or Gelish. I would rather wait there than settle for this. I was with two friends who happen to be Vietnamese. When I sat down I was asked about my ethnicity. From me being Korean, they automatically assumed my friends were as well. In the duration of my pedicure, me opting for gel makes me "full of money." I don't think I should have to justify my decision in preferring gel considering it lasts longer. My friends got a simple pedicure with normal polish and on the contrary they also commented how they were cheap for their choice. Their conversation led to them talking about how ugly we are compared to other Koreans and discussing how plastic surgery is popular there. To top it off, there's gel polish on my cuticles and I probably could've done a better job myself. I work hard for my money and treat myself accordingly. This will not be my choice in the future.”

## Tips from customers
Best pedicure ever! Get Amy she is the absolute best! Love this place! Nice, chill ,not overpriced at all!! I FOUND MY NEW SPOT! I love the pedicures. The mani pedi is $37 so I got one this time. A few cuticles were cut too short and are bleeding today. Otherwise very good. Sanitary and thorough. Wonderful service and such a beautiful place! The deluxe pedicure is worth the extra 10 bucks! Longest massage ever!!! Definitely suggest just taking the time to call at least an hour ahead, or two if it's a Friday night or weekend to make an appointment. Worth it every time! Trying this place again, looks like they've made some improvements Definitely worth it to make an appointment to avoid long waits on the weekend. This place is never slow and always busy, so call ahead! Just don't waste your time. Jordan is the go to guy! Great service and my nails always come out as I want ! Gorgeous mani/pedi place. Fast service. Friendly. I think i will love it! New and clean! Excellent chairs, massage, and feet scrubbing!

- “Terry was very responsive when we had an emergency plumbing issue.  Being out of town made it worrisome for us, but he helped us out with every step and solved the problem quickly with great customer service.”
- “I called Terry Monday at 8 am and I had a plumber at my house by 10 am that same day. Friendly and fast is an understatement. The plumber was extremely thorough at checking to see what my problem was. I thought I had a leak in my master shower, but with his thoroughness and knowledge and after looking both inside the home and out he concluded it was a drain issue. I did not end up using them for this problem as this was a much bigger issue than what their services cover. However I will not hesitate in the future if needed. Fast, friendly, and inexpensive!!!”
- “I discovered a leak under my kitchen sink and unfortunately, my usual plumber couldn't make it until the next week. I called Terry and he was able to make it out that day. He was also very accomodating. Since I'm currently working from home, I couldn't have people over during specific time periods, so he was able to come after my final class of the day.  Terry was quickly able to confirm the issue with the sink and had the parts available to fix it during that same visit. The cost was comparable to what we would have paid anywhere else.   He's an incredibly friendly and kind man and I'm so glad he was able to fix our sink so quickly and efficiently. He also came wearing a mask, which I know is important to most people during this time.”

- “I just watched a video they sent out from a video inspection of a drain line. They were supposed to have cleared roots from the line. They didn't get them all and the video they sent was taken from a cell phone of the camera monitor. You couldn't see much because of glare. I was able to see alot of roots still in the line though. It was as if they were trying to create glare to make the roots less visible. They charged 1300 dollars to cable a drain line from a clean out and then run the camera. They broke some camera doing this. I see ads on tv where they will come clear any line and camera inspect the line for 79 dollars. I had never heard of Progressive plumbing before and I honestly hope I never have to even hear their name again. This was just plain poor workmanship, expensive pricing and shady tactics. Alot of plumbing companies in Tucson have shady tactics, but this one takes the cake.”
- “Very expensive and owner quotes prices on the fly with no reasoning - just what he thinks he can get out of you.  He uses your plumbing needs against you especially if an emergency - horrible customer service.  Also, he doesn't like debit/credit cards which is a hassle when one has to go to the bank to give him cash.      Based on his high prices, go with someone else - he doesn't do the work himself anyway.”

- “We are so happy we found Bretts Interiors!  We visited several stores, but the quality of the furniture at Bretts really impressed us.  We bought the set July 2020 but the salesman was very honest about the pandemic slowing things down. So they gave us a "loaner " leather sofa until our set arrived. It was worth the wait!! The few family and friends that have been able to visit (still pandemic) all comment on how gorgeous it is. Even our housekeeper asked where we purchased the set. Excellent customer service and quality.”

- “I bought a $1200 recliner approximately six years ago from Brett's. After three years, the back simply irreparably collapsed.The frame has a lifetime warranty, but this could not be fixed. So, Josh Brett was gracious enough to give me a "great deal." He would sell me the top of the line, a $1600 chair for $799, a 50% discount. I accepted that deal. I didn't go to a less expense place because I wanted to be certain I was getting quality. Josh insisted it was some sort of defect. I bought the second chair on April 14, 2013 . Four day delivery. Something happened at the factory and it arrived April 30, 2013, just under 3 years ago.  In the summer of 2015, the back began to give way and not fully erect. I called and was referred to their "service man." After a few calls, he returned the call and said he wouldn't come out for that and told me how to do it myself. I went through the exercise of taking the back off and tightening the nuts that were loose. That lasted a day or so.   In September, the leather on the right arm developed a hole, which continued to grow in size to about five inches when I purchase a chair cover to hide it and keep it from spreading. The leather is only guaranteed for one year, however, against normal wear.  I figured a chair this expensive would last, should last. I called Josh Brett and he would charge $400+ for the leather replacement and take care of the back, except for the labor (the greatest expense of the repair). It would cost $200 to $300 for the labor. I asked, "so, there's nothing you can do?" Brett's reply was simply, "no." Nothing else was said.   I would recommend you be careful of what you buy and think twice about this company's "so-called service." Price means nothing. My Lazy-Boy lasted eight years. Go somewhere where they give real service and read their warranty.”
- “I'm giving 1 stars only based off the chair I sat in and really liked.  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to actually sit in that chair since as I'm still waiting for it 16 days later. So Disappointed in the turn around time. Especially since I paid 1,600 up front for something I do not have. My only thought is they didn't want to pay for shipping on a few items and waited for other customers to buy stuff and make a complete shipment for them. The problem with that is that it makes your customer service look bad. If I don't get my chair soon I'm going to have to cancel my order and go somewhere with a much quicker turn around time, like Copenhagen!  UPDATE: 17 DAYS AND COUNTING.....  So after 3 weeks of waiting for my "NEW CHAIR"  what I got was the floor model cause They were tired of me calling. This chair came with all the scratches, dents and of course dust from being in the store!!! YOU GUYS CAN HAVE THIS CHAIR BACK TOMORROW AND I WANT A FULL REFUND”
- “Quite simply, the worst retail experience of my life.  I purchased a $7,000 leather sectional in November'15, which was defective and completely unacceptable from the day it was delivered.  It took over 9 months, and involvement with my attorney, the State Attorney General's office, and finally disputing the charge with my credit card company to get my money back.  So much for wanting to support a local Tucson business!”

- “Came here when they first opened, food and atmosphere is better than ever great Mountain View's and great sunset. And of course food is excellent!”
- “Some of the best tacos I've ever had. We randomly picked a restaurant that had a dog friendly patio because our dog was with us and it turned out to be a gem. Great food, great atmosphere, great view of the Catalina mountains, and very friendly staff. The GM came out and brought our dog water and kept bringing us water without us even asking. Will definitely be coming back next time I'm in town.”
- “So glad to have Seis here in Oro Valley! The space is gorgeous and spacious and there's a lovely patio with a view of Pusch Ridge. We visited and enjoyed some delicious margaritas and split the nachos - so yummy and plenty of food to share. You order at the counter and they deliver the food and drinks to your seat. Our service was quick and the everything was delicious. The watermelon marg is one of my favorite in town. Welcome to OV!”

- “Forget the food. It can't be good enough to make up for this awful service. They slowed down the kitchen to the point where you had to wait 10 minutes in between each order. They then took 30 minutes just to get the food and they ran out of soda syrup. If you're going to open, do it effectively or don't open at all. We won't be back.”
- “The service is terrible. They said the wait would be 10 minutes but it ended up being 30.a family cut us in line. We didn't get any utensils and we had the ask. They made us wait 10 minutes to order plus waiting for 30. This is the worst. There are flies on the floor. Dead and alive.”
- “This place is a disaster. No one picks up the phone for to go orders and goes to a general mailbox. So I go there and the line is out the door for what is nothing more than a fast food chipotle restaurant. Don't even bother with this fake so called Mexican dining establishment”

- “Last couple times I've eaten here has made me sick, think they're undercooking the meat or something and also heard from a friend recently that he got sick from eating undercooked chicken as well. Food has really gone downhill at this location basically any other location in town is better. They put way too many eggs in their burritos to make up for the lack of other ingredients, think this is done because it's cheap but considering I'm not a huge fan of eggs I find it pretty disgusting. I only say all this because I'm comparing it to the other locations and their super fries aren't good either. The meat is always fatty and chewy. Go to another location or honestly just some place better, there are tons of better places to go that also have better customer service”
- “They need to have someone taking orders at the drive through who understands English. I had it with getting home with Fitos with dinner and it's a mystery bag of food. Calling up to tell them they messed up and all they do is argue with you saying you did not say that. I'll not be going back. I'm tired of wasting my money by throwing my food away. I guess if you speak Spanish life is good for a Fitos order... I'll not be going back, ever!!!”
- “No, I'm sorry but this food just was not good. I'm not very picky and I wouldn't go here again”

## Tips from customers
Slow service in the drive thru sometimes. Food is awesome though. Check your food well before leaving.   Found blonde/brown hair in my food on 22 Feb 2014 @2pm.   Managers only work 6-8 am so no quality control or speaking with them outside those times. Best meal on that side of the tracks. Consistent food and decent prices. Always fresh and delicious!! Gangbangers working as cooks. Be careful This place is gross and way overpriced Always quick and fresh. Lots of food for the price. I love the tostadas. Have been going there since it opened, never disappointed:)

- “Wasted a bunch of time on this visit to Phoenix searching for a nail salon that could indulge my preference for a dipping powder manicure. While I did find one salon in Chandler, it wasn't till I stopped for a girls' day pedicure with my cousins that I discovered this gem in Gold Canyon.   Canyon Nails has been in this location and run by the same crew for 16 years. They offer everything from dipping powder (yay) to acrylics and gel and provide relaxing and attentive salon services at reasonable prices. I wish they'd come to New Mexico where the healthier and longer lasting dipping powder manicure is almost non-existent. They didn't over-sell their service and there was no pressure for more expensive services I didn't want. Better yet, I watched their thorough and careful cleaning after the pedi was over and our toes dried.   Definitely on my list for my next visit!”
- “Excellent nail salon. Best spa pedi I have had in a very long time. Tina did an amazing job and she is so kind. The salon is very clean and the spa chairs were very comfortable. I highly recommend Canyon Nails!”

- “My friend and I made an appointment for 4pm on a Sunday (they close at 5pm).  We get there at 4 and had to wait over half an hour.  A few "walk-ins" came in behind us and when they asked how long it would be the lady told them around 15 minutes.  They were still there waiting when my friend and I left after 5pm.  Our pedicures were rushed and my massage chair didn't even work.  I got my pedicure 2 days ago and suddenly today I got this strange RASH on just one toe!  I will keep an eye on it for a few days and if it gets works I will go to the doc and update you.  I understand that they want the business, but lying about wait times is just the worst!”
- “I'd been going to this salon since I moved to Arizona in June 2016.  I moved to Vail a year ago and continued to make the 45-60 minute drive but after today's treatment I will NEVER go back. I called and made an appointment a week ago, when you make an appointment they always ask for your phone number, which they write down in their appointment book (one would presume it is so they can call you if there was an issue).  I was shocked when I arrived today, after my almost one hour drive, to hear Jenny was double booked (at this point I'd already been there for almost 20-minutes).  I was told I needed to come back tomorrow because somehow the the other ladies appointment wasn't in the book, and yet mine was and I'm the one who got told to come back tomorrow???  The real pisser for me was she told me she realized YESTERDAY that there was a schedule conflict and yet no one bothered to call.  I asked her why, when she knows I drive from Vail, she didn't just call me yesterday, tell me there was an issue and reschedule?  She just kept saying she was sorry and didn't know how the other ladies appointment got erased ... but couldn't explain why no one called to reschedule with me before I drove from so far away or why I'm the one who got turned away??  I was the appointment in the book and I was fifteen minutes early.   For the past year people have asked why I'd drive so far when there are closer salons?  I guarantee you I will not be going out of my way to come here in the future.  Im so disappointed in the way this was handled today.  One phone call to me yesterday showing some common courtesy would have kept me as a client but instead today I saw how little my patronage is valued.  If Yelp allowed me to rate zero stars I would.  Good luck keeping clients when you cater to snowbirds and screw over your year round clients.”

- “Great selection - hundreds of frames and some even starting at $9 and nice. Plus fast, polite and efficient service. Everyone seemed happy and competant and the Optician Susan who waited on me was fantastic. I went to buy one cheap pair for driving, and bought 2 distance and one pair of readers for what I would have spent at Target or Lenscrafters, since it's 20 percent off for the 2nd and 3rd pair.  Also added reflective and sun shading. Why not, it was affordable!!!!”

- “OK, I have to start out that i thought I would get decent service. But every moment of my experience was like they were talking to me like a child. I was told what to do with out explanation of what was occurring or why, mostly robotic, and somewhat condescending and telling me what my needs were even though i was requesting completely different features. Staff was constantly interrupting me as I was trying to explain what I wanted, instead, they were trying to make take services I didn't want.  I bought two distinct glasses with completely different features and somehow they made two identical glasses, when I informed them of the error, they tried to blame me. and then tried to up-charge to fix a problem that was theirs. I had paid my bill in full. then they attempted to make a doctors appointment saying they needed to check prescription, but that was not the issue they just messed up order and didn't want to correct it. then they wanted me to make an appointment just to get a refund. staff was completely rude. a simple refund would have taken less than a few minutes and somehow they stretched it out to 45 min. 5 people in the story including the manager and no one addressed me at all when i went for a refund. pretended like they didn't even see me, I couldn't even enter the eye center until someone allowed me in and after asking me a series of questions about covid just to enter. while the entire Walmart was packed with no limitations. I waited patiently for roughly 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledge me. completely rude staff. Manager was the worst. Don't leave the store until you are sure you get what you Paid for. I am a 60 year old man and this manager spoke to me like i was some small child. and even did it to someone behind me. Ask the couple to come back in an hour to set up an appointment because they were just to busy, but there were no customers in the store. They were telling everyone that every transaction needed an appointment. Believe the reviews they are real, your will get crappy service and they make you jump through hoops just to get some service. I predict that the entire staff will be replaced by years end. I'm just saying.”
- “The ladys in the front were wondeful however, I Will not be returning. I was seen by Doctor Coopers and he is extremely rude . he did not greet me or ask me my name .  I had to ask him his name 5 minutes into my appointment. His behavior indicated to me he didn't want to interact with me because I am African American. I refuse d to pay my  hard earn money  therefore I walked out and left . bottom line treat people how you would want to be treated. Customer service should be your goal and everything else will fall into place .”
- “I have been wearing corrective lenses for 70+ years and this was the worse experience I've ever had.  The receptionist simply handed my new glasses to me and the  frames  so were bent they didn't fit at all and they made no attempt to adjust them.. Even worse , the  O.D., Gary Grammond., did not re-examine me with them and the script was so wrong it was impossible to see with them.   I intend to  file a complaint with the corporate and the manager and the state board,  and will never patronize this Walmart again.”

- “I was driving for work and had a sudden craving for wings!!! So I looked up the closest spot and it happend to be wingstop. I am not gonna lie the location on Campbell is my go to for wings usually. I was slightly unsure how to order just for my self as I usually order for the whole family (5 people min). The woman on the phone helped me and was so very nice. I showed up about 15 minutes later and the food was right on time. In person the employees where just as friendly. All in all a good 5 star experience for this type of place. If I am In the area again I'll definitely be back.”

- “I used to do WingStop once a week. Now I frequent the other places in town which are superior only due to the fact that the cooks follow directions. Also about 1.5 years ago Wingstop shifted to some Frankenstein sized giant wings. The skin to meat ratio is completely off and the size is kind of disgusting tbh. But here is the real problem.... the staff is nice and perfectly decent but just dim. On repeated visits over the past year, I ask for well done wings, extremely well done. Really I just want the skin to be a little bit crispy. I even receive assurances at the register and told specifically they will be 23 minutes cook time. Then the fkn retards serve up my order less than 20 minutes later and insist they are well done. Soggy skins, chunks of fat that has not melted, etc. I even pointed this out and just received BS from the staff for the last time. Fk them. They didn't even offer to fix the order even though the staff had to clean the table and throw away a basket full of uneaten wings (8+3). Wingstop is disgusting now.... with their monstrous and undercooked wings.”
- “A large fly was cooked into my wings and covered in sauce.   Threw away the rest and threw up what I ate. Won't be coming back.”
- “Wings are dry and bready with way too much salt. Not healthy at all! I even tried the corn which was way too spicy I could not enjoy the meal. I have tried this place twice because I want to like them but its always a disappointment.”

## Tips from customers
Found coupon in a mailer for 3 free wings with a combo order. They've got online ordering available! But make sure to call a few hours beforehand to confirm order. (They said they never received my order) Luckily I went to pick up my order early, there was enough time to make my entire order! If you're in a rush, this isn't the place, about 25 minutes to get six wings, but, they're delicious!! Large wings and good portion size options. ewww!! This place is diarrhea-ville :( no bueno. Getting my negro modelo and hot wings on! Order ahead - wings take 16 minutes Brennan is very rude I'd love to pop him in his fuckin mouth lmao Friday night after the movies my girlfriend and I decided to stop at wing stop for wings, the white girl as the cashier was so rude(Kelly) , we decided to make our order to go since all the tables were dirty while only two were being occupied, not only was she rude to me but was rude to the customers she attended while I was in the store, her position should be re evaluated and replaced with someone more friendly that had a desire to make her customers return This place is awful. I had to wait for 2 hours for my wings that weren't even that good.

- “the hamburger had a little piece of plastic inside it.  from the looks of it , it looked like it came off a piece plastic bag . .  do not eat here how do you not relize there is plastic on the food.”
- “This place has been a favorite in my family since childhood. There aren't many around me so whenever I go through Tucson, I usually feel compelled to stop. I couldn't find the old school one in the classic A-frame building I used to go to, and feel sentimental about still, but found a newer, cleaner, updated one. Not a bad thing at all. I had seen the commercials and drooled about the pastrami dog all weekend, so I had to give it a try. Got it and jumped in the car, and hit the road  towards the valley with fries and A big Mountain Dew/Sprite mixture I whipped up at the fountain. I gotta say, it was worth the detour and will be again and again. The pastrami dog is a home run out of the park experience. The pastrami is moist and very flavorful, quite deli-like, and a pleasant surprise. The dog compliments it perfectly along with the soft bun, condiments and pickles. I can still almost taste it hours later as I write this at home. A good price and value too. Of course, the long prized DWS chili dog will always be my fave, but I will be getting these bad-boys while I can! A great invention like the Baconator!  It's a great treat when I want something different, I'm on holiday, and off the beaten path. I only wish I had one near me. Thanks, DWS!”

I brought my 3 kids here and ordered corn dogs, they came out so burnt that they couldn't bite into it. I kindly asked for a corn dog that wasn't burnt and the lady blatantly ignored me and walked away. My husband simply asked if I just got ignored and I said yes and the cashier walked over with the corn dog and said here is your corn dog, she did not ignore you she got you the corn dog. When I mentioned I would contact the owner she said that she was the owner. I said I doubt the owner would run their establishment this way, she proceeded to stay in the back and talk shit. She should be fired, she makes the establishment and the owner look bad, not to mention she lacks fundamental customer service skills to work a customer service job. Worst experience”

Ordered take out cashew chicken and egg rolls (basic staple items on a Chinese food menu right?) and the food was not only NOT good but we ended up throwing it away (first time ever done that!)   Egg rolls were mushy and tasted fishy and cashew chicken was bland, tasteless and also had a squashy texture to it.   Although employees were friendly, it's best to skip this place!”
- “Szechuan duck was beyond awful.  sauce didn't resemble any szechuan sauce I have ever had -- more like a bottled watery sweet and sour sauce.   i threw it down the disposal, inedible and quite expensive.”
- “If you have ever eaten great Chinese food, you should never eat what they call food at this place. The items we ordered ranged from barely edible to terrible. It was a total waste of time and money. As my son used to say "Yechhhhh!" when having something very unpleasant in his mouth - like foul tasting medicine.”

They typically have rice noodles, mint, pork, shrimp and slivers of lettuce all neatly rolled into a rice wrapped. Theirs have loads of rice noodles lettuce and a couple shrimp. Vastly inferior and mediocre. Very disappointed! Always good and excellent price! Awesome food, great service, also great for delivery.

- “I went to purchase Curlformers. The top up packages, $13.99, were on sale for $2 off. At the register the price didn't come off. And the Cashier checked to see what sign I saw, turns out it was from last month. They did not honor the sale and she ripped the tag up. Pretty bad customer service.”

- “We just had our living room floor finished by Rogo's and couldn't be happier with the job they did at every point in the process.  We asked a lot of questions and all were answered satisfactorily.  The workmen who came out were very conscientious in keeping everything tidy and keeping the disruption to our home to a minimum.  The wait was worth it when we got to move our furniture in and put our rugs down on our new floor yesterday.  Even the dogs like it.  Thank you so much Steve, Felipe and son!”
- “We contacted several concrete stain professionals to get estimates, and Steve at Rogo's responded in a prompt and professional manner. We had a quote the next day. We visited the showroom to discuss color options and styles. We wanted the front walkway and entrance area to be updated from old, stained (water damage) and cracked naked concrete. We decided on a Saltillo look and we couldn't be more thrilled with the work done. It is now a pleasure to sit outside with our morning coffee and watch the sunrise over Pusch Ridge. Our front entrance area is now a living space and will increase curb appeal and value to our home!! Thank you to Jorge and Ramses for doing excellent work!!”
- “I'm a local real estate agent here in Tucson, so I have the pleasure of dealing with tons of contractors, not just for my own homes, but for my clients homes as well. I have to say I'm usually not impressed with their work ethic, communication skills, or sometimes the job itself. I work really hard to find good people to refer to my clients because I want my clients well taken care of, and Rogo's, particularly Albert, is someone I would refer to my clients with confidence. I just remodeled my own home and had a string on contractors working on different projects here. None of the other contractors even compared to Albert's service and care with our house. I had them do a cement overlay on the existing tile countertops, and they came out beautifully. They matched the color sample I found perfectly and went out of their way to make sure their work was done on time, correctly, and cleaned up before they left. I love my new countertops and I would recommend Rogo's to anyone!”

- “I have been dealing with this company since 2011. I had a flood in my house, and when I had the repairs done, decided to "upgrade" my floors with a concrete overlay. The demo guys ripped a lamp that wasn't replaced, put three holes on my walls and ceiling, left the torn out tile INSIDE the house (while we we living there) to the point that we couldn't access half the house (hello fire hazard!), and scratched our brand new vinyl sliding glass door, to the point where they had to replace it. The installers did a beautiful job initially. When moving my refrigerator back inside, the scratched the doors and bent them so out of whack, that they had to replace them. Then, left all of the food that was inside of the fridge, outside in 110 degree weather...   The floor has bubbled under the cabinets, and cracked, they won't repair it. Then, (this one is the kicker) I was recently having problems with my guest bathroom toilet. The plumber informed me that he needed to pull up the toilet to get to the plug/roots that were in the pipe. MY TOILET WAS CEMENTED TO THE FLOOR. They sent a representative out to look at the giant issue... he said this isn't how they do their work, and took full responsibility for the problem. But, that's where it stopped. He wouldn't return a phone call, but he emailed me to tell me that he'd have to charge me to have their guys come out to fix the problem THAT THEY CAUSED. Are you f****** kidding me?! You cemented my toilet to the floor, and I have to pay for the repairs?!   Do NOT use this company for ANYTHING. You will be left with a disaster, and repairs you'll have to take care of yourself. My floor scratches so incredibly easily! It's terrible!!”
- “After researching and interviewing other flooring companies to restore concrete floors in our Joseler home my husband and I chose Rogo's based on reputation.  We did not know that the company subcontracts their work out so you could end up with "just anybody".  We ended up with "just anybody" and have nothing but regrets.  The floors and baseboards don't match, there are trowel marks, gaps and rough areas in the concrete, the decorative medallions were forgotten in one of the rooms, and the sealer was inconsistently applied so it puddled in some areas and is nonexistent in others.  My kitchen cabinets were never covered so there was sand in EVERYTHING, a toilet was broken, and some window hardware was broken.  So after 4 months of total disruption and 2 different contractors' attempts to correct the work the floors still look inferior to what we had expected.   Look elsewhere.”
- “I purchased a new home about six months ago, and the small back patio (less than 500 sq ft) had an acid stain and seal applied prior to my occupancy. I asked the previous owner who did the work on the patio as it was beginning to peel, fade, and was becoming an eye sore. The previous owner stated that Rogo's Finishing Touch did the patio work less than two years ago (2016). He gave us their contact information, and we called to set up an appointment for an estimate. The soonest appointment they had available was two weeks later. After scheduling the appointment, they called two days later to reschedule the appointment I made which caused me to take time off work to meet with them. The employee then showed up late for the rescheduled appointment which already caused concern. When the employee arrived, they looked at the job and talked about how terrible the work was and tried to deny that his company completed the job, but stated he would verify and include the information in the estimate that he would sent the following day. Figuring the work was less than two years old, I assumed it would be a reasonable cost to touch up the job and refresh the look. I received the estimate the next day and included in the document was a line which stated the original work was in fact completed by Rogo's. The estimate itself was for over $3100 dollars to repair/redo a botched job done by their own company. They included a second estimate for a wash and reseal for $1000 which they stated would not make the patio look better, but would prevent it from continuing to wear for some time. I was blown away by the ridiculously overpriced estimate and couldn't believe they were ok with charging that much to fix their own terrible work from less that two years ago. Clearly their work is not competed with any degree of pride or integrity, and will not stand the test of time. I will be calling other local companies for estimates this week and do not recommend anyone work with this company.”

## Tips from customers
NOT WORTH THE DAMAGE AND CLEANUP 
The floors are beautiful but they were 5 days late finishing the project.
Concrete spilled on our flagstone. The front lawn was their concrete and paint wash out area. Paint splatter on garage and front doors, walls, kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities, sliding glass door. Concrete splatters on walls, faucets, tub & surround. Sealant rings and spills on marble surfaces and bathroom vanity, drips down the stainless steel freezer door and dented freezer handle.

I stay here often and yes ,it is an older hotel but the beds are extremely comfortable and the staff is super friendly.I admit there are some flaws ,like there is only one elevator and its super slow,but the breakfast was always nice and I always slept terrific.There could be some upgrades made to the bathrooms like the floor tiles are old but it was always clean.”
- “This hotel is right outside of the Tucson Airport. It is one of the better Fairfield Inns. The people were friendly, the room was clean and roomy. Hurray for microwave and frig in room. The breakfast was one of the best with make it yourself waffles, very good. Apples, bananas, fruit juice and some ho hum pasteries were about all I remember. Price was good too.”

- “Hey guys, pick up the efforts on the housecleaning front...Pubic hairs everywhere after checking in to my room. Pretty nasty.”
- “My routine was usual: travel for business, stay at a Marriott property. I typically find each one acceptable (of course, "adjusting" for the property level). But this had "bad vibes" from the moment I approached the front desk. *** the clerk was on the phone, taking a reservation, and taking the time. Yes, customer service is important. But if there are more than two guests waiting to check in, typically someone steps out of the back office to help. Not here, though you hear voices from the office behind the counter. *** finally, I'm at the counter. Got the key, got the wi-fi code, and head to the elevator. Doors open, and you see a worn-out, tattered, sickly- green carpet on the floor. Ugh.. Ok up we go. The hallway smells like every guest ordered take-out and has not thrown out the left-overs!! *** Here is room 300, slide the key, open the door, look for the light. VOILA. Holy cow -I'm I someone else's room! There is an almost-empty water bottle at the sink, dirty towel next to it, a slept-in bed with pillows and covers strewn across it, an old newspaper. *** I call downstairs to clarify what's going on: the phone rings, rings, rings, and rings more &more. Aah, yes, there is only one clerk at the counter, and whoever else was in the office is "unable" to assist. Off I go schlepping downstairs with my luggage and laptop. *** I approach the counter, advising that I was either sent to an occupied room, or someone clearly did not do his/her job properly. I wanted to know how a used room was marked available for arriving guests!! Just a stare back and "I really don't know". Sorry, sorry, yeah, yeah -give me the key to a new room. But I requested someone verify it is clean, and only then made my way there. *** the following morning I head into the shower, turn on the water, throw the handle to extreme "hot" and climb in after a minute, only to discover the water is barely luke-warm. NOOO!! Step out, let it run for a bit longer, try again (with my hand) - no changes. Ring, ring, front desk. Has anyone called about no hot water in the shower?... No, no one has.... Well, my shower is barely luke-warm... Sorry, probably many people are taking a shower and using up the hot water, the hotel is sold out... Are you serious??? Hotels are built on an assumption of full capacity and are designed to supply hot water to all guests!! What do you suggest I do for a shower? ... Sorry, we are sold out... ((Omg this is not happening!)) *** go to the sink, turn on the water: the "hot" is piping hot!! Damn, the shower mixer must be broken. How is it the hotel management does to know that? Ring ring, front desk. Yes, it's me again, and FYI - the sink water is running very hot!... Really?... YES, so the water mixer in the shower must be broken... I'm sorry, I'll advise engineering. ((but still no shower)). *** as the last pathetic attempt to wash up properly, I literally forced my colleague, who was ready to head to the airport to catch an earlier flight, to return and open his room for me, to take a shower!!! How sad is that...  Upon check-out, it was confirmed the mixer in the room 300 shower is installed backwards: so "cold" gives you hot water, and vice versa. So if you know it, FIX IT, or don't put guests into that room!   Some to the manager, who has an attitude, regarding compensation for the "fun" experience. She said that she already deposited 1k points too my account, and is unable to do anything else... Ok! Thankfully, I don't foresee plans to travel to Tucson any time soon.. And if by unfortunate chance I will, this Fairfield will not be my lodging choice - ever.  The only positive thing I can say is there were cookies at the front desk upon check-in. But I cannot vouch for flavor or freshness: did not have any.”

- “I hope you never need a tow, BUT IF YOU DO these are the guys to call in the Tucson area.   ON A SUNDAY we were traveling West on I-10, some random truck in front of us had an unsecured load and a table fell off the back of their truck; table basically blew up in front of us. One of the legs of the table pierced our rental mini-van's radiator, destroying it. Van became undriveable. We limped off the freeway and ended up in someplace called Marana. We called AAA they said it was gonna be two hours for a tow. Fortunately for us, Arturo from A and L was there in about 35 minutes, had the mini-van loaded onto his truck in under 5 minutes and then he gave us a ride to the car rental office all the way back at the Tucson airport. Dude was a pro and super helpful. We are very appreciative of the service we got from this company. They made the best of our bad situation.”
- “I never expected to write a review for a towing company but here I am... My wife broke down one evening last week.  We had towing insurance and set up a tow. A&L was contacted.  At first, she was told the company would be an hour or two but upon learning she was alone on the freeway the owner of A&L showed up quick.  We needed our vehicle towed to the local dealer. Unfortunately it was closed until six in the morning and the car would need to be stored. Our tow service package required us to pay a fee and recommended we have it stored at our home and then another tow in the morning to the dealer.  The owner of A&L offered to store the vehicle at his cost and deliver it in the morning to the dealer.  This saved us so much time and frustration.  The next day it was delivered at 6am!  All we can say is thankyou!  The next time we need a tow we will be calling A&L.”
- “Today I unfortunately needed to have my car towed (on a sunday night ) and called roadside assistance and ended up having this company tow my car. They got there quick and gave us an ETA over the phone. The guy was very professional and patient even though my car was parked in probably the most inconvenient way for him to tow it.”

- “If I could give this place ZERO starts I would - this company was dispatched by my insurance to pick up my stranded vehicle, gave me an ETA of 90 minutes and when the 90 minutes past I called just to be told that my tow had been canceled & that I was out of luck and needed to call my insurance and get a different provider. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.”
- “MOST HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE EVER My son was stranded due to storms. After some mix up with the insurance company he was finally told 9 hrs later that someone was coming out to tow his car. 3 hrs later he was informed that this tow company would NOT come out til they were paid. The owner then told my son his money was more important than helping my son. He also told my son that it's his fault for leaving his vehicle there. I will never use this company and we ended getting another company to come out. Also put a complain't in with the insurance company.”
- “Tire was blown out. Called to see if I could get a tow from A & L. It has been over 2 hours and currently still waiting. Very unhappy. Very disatisfied. Use someone else if you can.”

- “I was killing time while in Tucson and rolled out to the local Indian casino to see what the hubbub was all about. As I drove up, the parking lot was swarmed with cars, and I just followed the directions of the parking lot attendant. Apparently there was a concert that evening.  I walked up to the ticket office to see who was playing, and a Mafioso looking Indian (feather, not dot) gentleman in a suit, turquoise bolo tie and boots put an envelope in my hands. "Enjoy" he said as he walked away.  I opened the envelope and inside were two tickets to see the world famous entertainer, Calvin Broadus. That's right. Snoop. Doggy. Dogg!  The amphitheater was a surprisingly intimate 5,000 seats. And for whatever reason, the venue was far from full that evening. I checked the seats numbers and sat down in row "ii". I asked the usher if we were in the right seats because we were less than twenty rows from the stage. Well apparently we were in the wrong seats, so he ushered us to row "i".   Yeah, that's right. NINE rows from the stage, dead center.   I bounced to classics like "What's my Name?" and "Gin and Juice", then later won $400 playing blackjack. I love you Pascua Yaqui Indian tribe!”
- “I love this place. It's the closest thing to a Vegas casino I've seen. Slots, table games and a poker room. The restaurants are all amazing and they have a good variety. Mexican, American, steakhouse and more. They have two Starbucks. Free entertainment some nights. Their concert venue is great, but the thing that stands out the most is the hotel. Beautiful rooms. The pool area is amazing, relaxing and fun. This is hands down the best thing in Tucson. There is something for everyone of all ages. In the summer my kids like staying there and enjoying the pool and restaurants. Sign up for a players club card. They send you great deals on rooms, free concert tickets and free play. The buffet is great, especially the Sunday brunch which includes champagne. Great job casino del sol.”

- “Poor selection of slot machines.  Tried the buffet and had bad service. Never had anyone check up on me or even get me a refill with an empty cup sitting on the table over half an hour. Food was also not good quality. Also felt sick the next day.  Went to a concert and it was delayed but they did not allow the band to play their full set.  I would still come back for concerts but not for any other reason. Also I would eat off property first.”

The house always wins Bingo is 20% off Thursday with ur club card. Cigarette smoke. ... coughing Tamale festival today In Tucson for work :( Poker machines FTW! Stay away! Without a doubt worse casino I've ever been too. Smells horrible, smoke filled, we watched for a while and no one won anything. This is one of our favorite places for date night. Never had a bad experience. Sunday-Wednesday swipe your card to be entered to win $125k Kinda like a super mini Vegas inside. Bar in the middle has beer/drink specials. For cheaper eats check out the Mexican restaurant Abuelitas. Some card tables, tons of slots, auto roulette. Check out some shows as well and special events. Order whole pizza from buffet for $15 or under surprisingly good. WET pool party is like MTV spring break! Good times! I signed a receipt for $7.50. They charged my account  $50.00. Curious. Ooooooo.... Ahhhhhh... It sure is pretty in here! I can feel the energy! little family get away :) Best place in Tucson $3 drink specials,  and I won $10 to boot!!! I love this casino!  The slot machines pay! I won a total of $1,150 in two days. Dinner at Moby's...waitress was great With the fam! Weekend stays are a must Vip bar pure joy Tim Mcgraw concert Here to see the lost 80's live Great hotel, beautiful surroundings and room was very comfortable and classy. At The Mardi Gras 2013 event in the Grand Ballroom. Also checked into a room. The decor is nice, bed, room is very clean, and bathroom is modern. Theres no tub. Im used to a full sized bathroom. But other wise, this is a very nice room. The Slots are great, but the Promotions, not so much. Have an open mind and don't expect too much. Drop off for CAB meeting then dinner. A small slice of Vegas in the Old Pueblo. Minus the free drinks. Good variety of slots & table games and restaurant selection. mariachi festival poolside :) Love all the slot machines bingo! Betting on Jesus lolz Try PY Steakhouse!!  Yum! At Estrella, ask for a room on Floors 2,4 or 6 where the Ice and Vending are located It's a great place to have dinner, see and concert and then stay the night, and have a nice morning swim the next day! No taste on the wine?! Fail! Alice and wonderland slot is fun! Party going strong at MTCVB @visittucson Holiday Celebration. Uh scallops Rumaki, a Pitt bull for adoption, an Eva Longoria lookalike.

Recommend fourth floor or higher if you don't sleep like the dead, casino is audible on third floor.. All night. Get an even numbered room for the pool side view. Odd side faces the parking lot- still lovely but not "resort" like. The buffet desserts are cute and delicious at the Festa Buffett. Wish us luck Do you feel Lucky? Always lively First trip to indian casino! Beautiful inside and out. Love this place. My new resort. If staying at the resort with kids....make sure you don't plan a weekend when the 21 and over party occurs. If you do then the pool will close at 10 am and WILL not open until the following day. Great casino Free overnight RV parking at the casino, I believe. I'm lookingforward yo try it. worst bar service, slow and they have a bad attitude. Cannot beat free rooms. :) The hotel is very rude! Actually everyone here is very rude here! Another great day at the pool! I can see the hotel!!! Service in the restaurants except for the steakhouse is abysmal. I hit the 5 dollar slot for 1200 Thursday good luck . Amazing michelados!!!! Or were they bloody Mary's?? Ordered the Rueben, which is my favorite sandwich. Beautiful sandwich came but after one bite, couldn't go further. Tasted terrible. Later, on the way home I got very, very sick. Will NEVER, ever, enter their restaurant again! These people are apparently not too adept at hosting a concert. Come prepared to be inconvenienced. 11-11-11. Work hard - play hard. ^^ Great casino for AZ And da casino. And da casino.

- “Food is yummy and healthy, great buffet style. Good fuel for studying at the library, especially for Midterms and Finals. Great options for carbs, fats, proteins.  However, the one-star is due to the lack of customer service - The cashier lady ALWAYS IGNORES me, DOESN'T make friendly conversation, pretends to look away when I exit to avoid saying goodbye, and sometimes creepily stares at me while I ate, but ONLY greets, and says goodbye, makes friendly conversation to the frat guys who eat here.”
- “Food is never good the place is always dirty and nothing is well kept. Cool first time you go but after that you realize how bad the food is and it stinks.”

Every time I go to this specific store I never leave  with my mission accomplished or satisfied. Iv been to several other FedEx stores and they help me with the things this store says 'they are not allowed to'. I am not being over critical, all I'm saying is avoid this store of possible.”

- “I've never had a problem at any FedEx Office until I came to this location. The first time I went here was to drop off a package that was prepaid and already had the label on. The person claimed the box wasn't strong enough and I needed to buy one of their boxes. This was untrue, but since I was on a time crunch and needed the package shipped that day, I caved and paid.  I thought I would give them one more chance. Again, I had a prepaid package in a very sturdy and thick box. Can you guess what happened?  The girl at the counter said "We can't ship in this box, you need to buy one of ours." I asked why, since FedEx had delivered a package to me in that very box two days ago. The girl's manager (maybe franchise owner?) came up and said the same thing. I again asked why since FedEx shipped the box two days ago. The manager said "We didn't ship you anything in this box.. the seller shipped it, and we just delivered it." What kind of double talk is this?! I told them "Fine, I'll go to a different Fedex then." and went to the one on Speedway. Of course, no problems there.  I'll never go back to this location. If they keep trying to force people to buy their boxes, no one will come and they will have to close down.”

- “One of my favorite places for good, consistent, & fresh mexican seafood.  The ceviche is bomb!  The cocktails are all good & the service is always superb.  Great place!”
- “Really great seafood! The oysters were delicious and so was the Chihuahuita! The Chihuahuita was my favorite. We also got stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon but I didn't like the cheese. Service was good too.”
- “It's peculiar that this location has a lower rating than others in town, because I've only had good experiences here. Really, few places make a legit ceviche in town and even fewer actually use mexican shrimp. So, Mariscos Chihuahua earns is 4 estrellas for that reason alone and for serving up an impressive Callos de Hacha. Yum! Fresh scallops (seasonal) that are super thinly sliced and marinated in lime juice, served with a ton of thinly sliced red onion, cucumber, tomato and avocado. The small is the perfect size for two people to enjoy this dish. Since the scallops are not marinated with the red onion, this dish is fresh as can be and not overpowered by any other flavors. The scallops are tender and buttery. I was transported back to my childhood vacations at the beach in Mexico. Although the scallops were the highlight of this visit, the ceviche was no dud. It too was fresh and citrusy. And if you assemble your tostada the right way (mayo, then ceviche, then avocado and some hot sauce).....you'll be in ceviche heaven in no time. It's also worth pointing out that the shrimp was deveined and very clean.....otherwise a major deal breaker for me. The ideal combo is to wash all this down with a crispy beer or a michelada! Service was so friendly, it felt like we eating at home. This spot is cash only....so remember to hit up the ATM before heading over!”

- “Worst customer service ! I went in with my younger brother and we both ordered lemonade. I had to get up and ask for a refill since she wasn't attending to us & when I asked for a refill of their  lemonade she said "there is no refill for that but I can give you soda instead" so I said sure that's fine when I go to pay she charges me for 4 beverages instead of 2 and begins to argue with me that she has to charge the soda also when she said in exact words the above. So I ended up paying $12 on 2 beverages. Then when she took our order she didn't ask whether we wanted salad, rice or fries so she brings me rice on the plate and I asked politely if I can have salad instead. She seemed to have attitude and start gossiping to all the girls standing behind the counter because they began to stare. Then, she tried charging me for the salad too!”
- “So I got caught in a monsoon this week and couldn't get to the grocery store. I figured the universe was telling me to pick up food so I came here and got the ceviche everyone raves about. Big mistake. HUGE mistake. I spent the night hugging the bowl and praying for a quick death. As I write this review, I am only up to bananas, rice and toast in my system. Do yourself and your stomach a favor and give this place a pass.”
- “The worst tacos? Quesadillas ? (Marlin) I've ever had.  They smelled badly and tasted worse. My husband has the bacon fried chicken meal. It was okay.”

## Tips from customers
Cash only Excellent Cash only... And well worth your pesos. The tostada especial is very good. Nice place to eat. Clean an friendly. Marlin tacos and fish fillet with garlic sauce are outstanding.

- “I went to TK because they have feeder guppies for the turtle we have. I waited with a gentleman who was getting 6 bags of fish, 10 of these and 10 of those, a couple of these etc. I had no problem waiting the 30 minutes, while I was, I was looking at the different fish and plants, the fish area was also filling up.   The girl back there was the ONLY one in the store working, there were several other employees hanging out up front. She helped the guy carry his bags to the front with the promise that she would be right back. She didn't return but was instead caught by another customer in fish and was answering his questions.   Another employee was walking by and I asked him if another employee could help in fish- to which he responded that he was only there to check if he could release a quarantined fish. I told him that the girl was great and helpful, but she never made it back after helping a customer. - He argued with me and told me that she was getting him not helping someone else. I pointed at her and said -no literally she is right there helping someone else. He looked over but continued his thing.   A few moments later an older man- 80 ish came over and asked if I needed help- Great! I said I needed feeder guppies and he yelled at me that there were no guppies there!- Now I can see the guppies, about 40 of them swimming around. -I tell him they are there, just on the bottom, he looks closer, steps next to the tank and says -yes there are a few.  He awkwardly counts out ten and puts them in a bag- but is unable to catch air in the bag and tries to add air to no avail. He rubber-banded it and gave me a sad limpy bag o' fish.   I have never been yelled at when trying to purchase something, WOW- I also get that they were busy, and waiting was going to happen- but why if you have employees standing around doing NOTHING! I have also read other reviews and have read the owner yelling at people on here when he doesn't like what they say. Unfortunately that will most likely be my fate, but you have to do better and be nicer if you want a better review. I hope that someday I can give a better review, because this store is a happy memory from my youth.”
- “Great place to go If you want to be around anti masker, dead animal, and stench. Went in recently looking for cherry shrimp and none of the employees were masked. Many of the tanks were full of dead fish as well. It's sad to see a small business disregard the safety of our community.”
- “Iv gone here twice, and this recent time was horrendous. Not that the workers there were bad but the birds were all over crowded in cages that would be to small for even one of them. There was specifically two parrots and one wouldn't get up. Please don't ever give them your money until they're able to keep up and treat their animals decently.”

## Tips from customers
Buy 10 bags of dog food, get the 11th free! For such a big store there were no cute accessories or outfits for dogs Very helpful, great prices on crickets for my bearded and Chinese water dragons and advice, nicely surprised they were open on a recent holiday (sorry you had to work!), very highly recommended. Thank you very much! caution: anti-maskers during a pandemic Great place to shop.    Kind and friendly employees very helpful An okay environment Great place for anything pet related!

- “The main post office on cherrybell is awesome. Nice people, open till 7, and open Saturdays!  Love it.”
- “This post office is not the closest to me, however is great to ship packages out with extended pick up hours. I work a 9-5 job so trying to get to the post office during lunch is not the most ideal, however this post office does final pick up at 7pm which gives me the time to ship everything! I was in a pinch today where two post offices I went to had FULL boxes and this one surely saved the day! I typically do self service, but usually when I go to the counter the staff is fairly nice”

- “The lady who attended me was very rude. She was  yelling at me about a pen that was her's and was rude when I told her that I needed a passport. She was of no help and instead was yelling at me because I told her that another USPS sent me, she just said " first of all they are wrong they don't know how we work." She had no intention to help me or direct me to the correct place, she only said go online!”
- “I showed up for my passport appointment that I scheduled online and no one was there. Please fix your scheduling kiosk if that is the issue.”

I made an appointment for 1045, showed up at 1035, of course there was a line of people who DIDNT have an appointment. I didn't think anything of it considering I did have an appointment so I wouldn't have to wait...I was wrong. I don't know who this male worker was but he was middle aged, bald and EXTREMELY rude. Paid zero attention to people who had appointments and continued to help people who didn't have one, even when I pointed out that I had an appointment. After 45 minutes of waiting I went up to the counter and told them I've been waiting 45 minutes for an appointment i had made. A nice gentleman named Ray helped me out when he wasn't even the one originally doing the passports.  Oh and on top of it a female worker with glasses had a sour attitude towards people for zero reason.  Your people and customer service skills are absolute trash.”

## Tips from customers
Come early no wait!!! Amazing location, no line!! Open till 8 and last pick up at 9 Hours are now 9 to 7 M-F. 8:30 to 3:30 Sat. And closed Sun and holidays. I love that they're open late on Saturdays! No matter the time it's always busy They are impatient, and behaved like they were pissed off for no reason.

## Tips from customers
30 min. Still don't even have a glass of water or menu. Music so loud that every time I try to get someone's attention, they don't hear me. Saw signage going up today!...Can't wait for you to open so we can Happy Hour there! Super rude employees, don't appreciate getting shoved by employees. I don't think their drinks have alcohol in them. Have never had a good experiences. Last time I was here my friend got shoved onto the ground. Today a bouncer spilt a drink all over my friend and I who bought a table. His name is supposedly Tom, but that is most likely a fake name. And the manager who is an Asian supposedly named nick is very rude and everyone that works here has anger issues, major ones Great Bartenders in the afternoon and amazing music on Sunday on the patio.  Very nice. Don't bother with the two pool tables.  Afternoon manager tells you how to play then gets in the game and rips you off. They don't let people with jerseys in Awesome time!! With great food and a fun vibe!

The driver brings the bags in and refuses a tip. What a great service for those who can no longer drive and walk the isles with ease.”

Brah, we can drive up in the Mercedes Daddy bought for us (or some of us sucked dick for, let's be honest) and prance around in our wife beaters and spandex to show everybody we're really hardcore about working out and would pump iron at the drop of a pin, brah!

I called at 9 and was told the driver was behind schedule but should be here momentarily. Waste of time, would never order from them again. Not only did it not save me any time, the hassle of calling around and having to stay up late totally negated any benefit of not having to go to the store myself.”

## Tips from customers
Lines always long for gas... If you need anything, Jason is the man! The butchers here are amazing! Gas station They sell gas here too for your car! Great people watching... Especially on a Friday or Saturday night when the college kids are gearing up for their night of drinking :)

Oh. And they have good produce too. Apparently the breakfast sandwiches are NOT made to order, despite what the sign says. Last minute Super bowl supplies A little dumpy Gas is cheap when you shop at Safeway Don't shop here on Saturdays.....we're talking 10 aisles of lines no exaggeration. UofA 10% student discount here on Saturdays. Only 1 of 2 Safeways. Starbuck Redeem Safeway gas rewards points here Ask the butcher to cut/tenderize/marinate any cut. Free baby! Apple Pay here! Great selection of gift cards! Picking up Dinner items. US Bank inside. Decent donuts here. Stay away from the deli. $3.01 a gallon after reward. Cheap gas! Bathroom break. Safeway sig salads are yummy but very inconsistent and sometimes are missing things in them :/

- “Our first sit down, get a snack and enjoy the air conditioning rest stop on our Desert Museum adventure today!   The Ironwood Terraces is lovely and a little tucked away in the corner of the museum so it's not usually over crowded. It's a cafeteria style restaurant with lots of options from burgers and fries to salads and grilled fish. Don't bother trying to find any obvious lines- just figure out what you want and go to that counter. Today our party was just looking for drinks and ice cream.   We decided to invest in the Desert Museum plastic cup - they are $3 -$4 depending on which design you pic (there are two different cups to choose from and they hold about 20-24 ounces each.) The best part is you get free refills "for the life of the cup!" Several Desert Museum employees mentioned the program to us, so we had to check it out.   Sure enough, every time we stopped at a restaurant, cafe or even the coffee bar while inside the Desert Museum, we were able to get a free refill (fountain drink or iced tea,) with our new magic cups. As we left, we were encouraged to bring our cups again next time too! What a deal! I guess they really really want to encourage hydration here!   The Terraces dining area is great - it was hot so we sat inside today. The views of the surrounding museum desert gardens are still beautiful and the overhead ceiling fans circulating the A/C on a 90 degree day in Tucson like today, felt marvelous to this Seattle girl!  3 stars for grill/cafeteria dining, 4 stars for friendly and excellent customer service and 5 stars all the way for ambience, whimsy (metal insect art... look up in the dining room,) and absolutely breathtaking Sonoran Desert beauty!”
- “Good food & great service. Loved the avocado Reuben and the Cuban carnitas sandwich. We were pleasantly surprised as we knew the museums excellent reputation but hadn't heard about the restaurant. Shelly was our waitress & her great attitude really made for a great experience. Lovely ambiance!”

- “Watch your bank account for duplicate charges!  I bought a coffee there 3/23, they charged me that money.  Then, in the month of April, I wasn't even in Tucson, and they charged me the same amount again on my card.  Contacted bank manager and emailed the desert sonoran museum.  Its disappointing.”
- “The cafeteria at the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum was recently taken over by a new service contractor, and I regret to say that the results are extremely disappointing. The new menu offers many fewer options most notably in salads: no more Dorado Fish or Desert Cobb. One of my dining companions was dismayed to find slimy, rotting leaves in her mixed salad greens. The sandwiches, burgers, and pizzas are of much lower quality. The serving sizes are much smaller than before, and the prices are higher. The free-to-members coffee and iced tea are now only served in the Phoebe's Cafe near the museum entrance. Re-fillable souvenir cups no longer come with bottomless free re-fills. I cannot in good conscience recommend this experience to anyone. Much better to bring a lunch from home and use the  well-appointed picnic area next door.”
- “We have been Desert Museum members for many years. Therefore we have eaten here for many years. We ate here this week after not for about a year. The food was terrible! I'm so disappointed. The green chili cheeseburgers taste frozen and not charbroiled and the green chili is now tiny pieces, when before it was large strips. We couldn't finish them. The kids ordered cheese pizza kid meals. The pizza was so bad they didn't eat it?! No kid meals either-they used to come with animal cookies, etc. but now it's a horrible 'pizza' and drink. I can't say how disappointing this was and now we will choose to eat elsewhere before we visit the museum.”

## Tips from customers
The food here is good.  Cafeteria style but they cook everything to order. Buy a large souvenir cup and get free refills all day.. Nice dining options inside and outside on the terraces- all are cool and well shaded with beautiful views of the Museum gardens nearby!

I went in with questions on where I could find a couple of things in the store, the employees would just point me in a direction and tell me" it should be that way by this or that". They were not helpful at all and rude. I usually go to the Michaels on Broadway and Kolb, they are always nice to their customers.

I used the phone app to redeem a coupon. Yeah Making Cup Quequitos' shirts! I enjoy that I get whatever crafting supply I need here, but I honestly think it's the least intuitive store ever. I need to ask for help every time! Huge selection Trevor b rocks!!!!! Give him a raise It's what I picture hell to be like....

- “Been here since October 2015 in the RV section. The entire complex is clean and well-kept. Staff very friendly, residents very friendly. After looking at several RV parks in the area I chose this one because of it's convenient location, overall Appearance, and cost. They have a beautiful pool area that is well-kept grounds that are well-kept and in my honest opinion the best deal in town for rates. Having grown up in the Tucson area back in the 70s 80s and 90s, I  considered it to be in a very safe part of town on the far east side and is very quiet.”
- “Spending our second winter here and loving it.  Am so impressed with the number of activities offered each day.  It is heartwarming to see so many seniors enjoying each other and the fun things to do...3-4 things every day plus extras every week. This place is clean, safe, well managed and very welcoming.  I can understand now why it is so popular.  I feel so much at home and while I missed home a lot at first, this place has really grown on me.”

- “We stayed here a month during Feb to March.  I have a certified service dog and twice during this month I have taken him for a walk in this park.  Each time I was met by people that yelled and scolded me about my dog telling me I was not allowed to walk him in certain areas and that he was suppose to stay in the middle of the road.  I tried to explain that he was protected by ADA and could go anywhere I could go but they continued to yell and make me feel uncomfortable.  I have spoke to other people that stay in the RV section and they all say they also have problems with the permanent residents. If you come in an RV you are considered the "red headed step child". I will never come back here again because of the attitudes that the residents have towards dogs and the people that live in RV's.  I would strongly advise anyone that travel with dogs to stay away from this park.  They say they are dog friendly but they really aren't.”
- “Let me start by saying that we did not stay here so this review is not about the amenities or appearance. It is based our experience on checking into the park. We made a reservation a week in advance and  drove over 5 hours to get to this Tucson park. I even called to confirm our reservation while we were on the road and everything was all set. Got there (no problem), checked in (very friendly), drove to the holding area to unhook our car and wait for the host to guide us to the site (problem starts). As my husband and daughter are unhooking the car, the camp host looks at my daughter and says "no one under 30 is allowed to stay in the park"! What? We knew it was a 55 and over park and both my husband and I qualify. My daughter is 23, an adult, traveling with us and we've been to many 55 parks and never had this issue. The host called the owner to check with her and she agreed that we could not stay and said many other 55 parks have this policy. Now it was after 5, and other parks in the area were closed, and the Walmart's in Tucson don't allow overnight camping so we drove another 45 minutes into Benson and stayed at the SKP Saguaro Co-op. This turned out to be a blessing because everyone is amazingly friendly and we loved it so much we stayed almost a month. But I wanted to let others know of Tucson Meadow's "policy" (which by the way is not on their website), incase you are also traveling with 55 or younger adults or children.”

- “best thing about PetSmart is that they let you price match other pet stores and even online if you find some products are cheaper than theirs and it's same products they will match that price for you.

- “Traveling in our 5th wheel.  Looked like a nice place to relax for a week and get caught up on haircuts for hubby, me and the dog.  We have a small English Springer Spaniel that my husband is learning to groom.  He had given her a bath and a haircut but it needed some touch-ups.  He was nervous about shaving around her eyes and left Brandi with a heavy brow.  But most importantly were her feet.  The area around Sahuarita/Green Valley is covered in cacti and thorns.  Having her feet shaved closely would make seeing and removing thorns much easier.  Made an appointment for the nextday at 8 am.  Arrived at the store a little before 8.  The doors wouldn't open and it said they're not open until 9am.  Very puzzled ? Beside the store hours were the groomer hours whichsaid 7:30-6:00...?  I noticed the doors weren't locked, but the automatic opener wouldn't open.  I put my hands between the doors and pulled as hard as I could and the door opened.  Huge store so I asked an employee where the groomer was.  He pointed me in the right direction. Don't u think the employee making this appointment should have mentioned the procedure for getting into the store and finding the groomer??!  Off to a bad start.  I had never been to a PetSmart so wasn't familiar with their grooming options.  Online they had an option labeled Basic but it wasn't posted in the store.  The "basic" online included washing, haircut, nails and pads, anal gland cleaned, ears cleaned and hair trimmed, and a scarf. (There May have been other services included.  Just don't remember.). They also had a another packages that included brushing teeth.  I asked that that Brandi's teeth be brushed.  The receptionist (who was very pleasant and tried to be helpful) brought Brandi out with long nails, unshaven brow, not a uniform haircut, one hind foot with long hair and no scarf.  I asked if the nails had been trimmed.  She didn't know and the groomer, Alyssa H. was on break and unavailable.  I was charged $71 for a below par service.  I had chosen PetSmart above the local groomers because the online info said they were all trained extensively by PetSmart.  Hmm    They have online booking on their site that is a mess!  I tried to use the it but mistakenly hit the prompt that Brandi was under 6 months (not sure of the exact old.  Their response was that they don't service dogs younger than 6 months.  I tried several times to correct my error but it wouldn't allow an update.  I tried entering Brandi 2 but the same message appeared.  Online also doesn't allow for additional directions to be included.  Very frustrating!!  I will never go to PetSmart again!!!”
- “February 28,2020 Shame on you for cramming 4-5 turtles in a nasty tank just inside at the front door. It's not even big enough for one. That is cruel. What is the reason for such cruelty??”
- “I have been a steady PetSMart shopper since they opened here in Sahuarita.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and they are always well-stocked.  Yesterday, though, I was very disappointed--there were two employees in the store neither of which were wearing a mask.  The cashier was behind plexiglass, but came out to help me with no face protection.  Another employee was in the aisle--also no mask.  I didn't worry for me as I did wear face protection.    This pandemic is no small thing.  I will not be shopping at this location again, and I sincerely hope management steps up and begins to take care of their employees and their customers.  If they resolve this I would totally give this store all five stars--but for this total lack of regard for the safety of others, I cannot.”

- “Isn't the point of Goodwill that you get stuff cheaper because it's used and it's meant to be a nonprofit? I guess I don't understand why literally most of the store is more expensive than buying the thing brand new on Amazon. So for used and possibly not working stuff with no guarantee that is sold as is, you're expected to pay more, even twice as much or the same price as brand new stuff that's guaranteed to work? Who exactly is pricing this stuff? Rich privileged old people who have no idea how much things actually cost and do not possess the skills to do a price check on the internet? Are they just like, "$10 for a cup! That sounds cheap! My cups are pure crystal and cost $80 each. They're getting a huge discount!" (They didn't price their cups at $10, but you get the idea. Whoever is pricing is definitely living in another world.) Something used without a guarantee should be at least half to a quarter the price as something new and guaranteed to work. Certainly not more expensive than buying it new! I am now so poor that I must buy everything new ... I can't afford to waste money on used and broken things from Goodwill at double the price as new!”
- “This is the most disorganized store I have ever seen. Yelp made me put one star. It gets zero stars from me.”
- “We have been donating to Goodwill Southern Arizona for years. We have donated tens of thousands of dollars in overstock, high end items and designer clothing. Our donations were always appreciated and gratefully accepted. While donating today at 4995 E. Speedway Blvd. in Tucson, we were insulted and discriminated against by an African American man, seemingly and obviously because we are Caucasian. It was plain simple racism and hate. It really put a damper on the spirit of giving and believing it is appreciated by Goodwill. This was a very disappointing and disgraceful experience that I hope is never repeated again. Goodwill, if you read these posts, WAKE UP. Train your staff so this doesn't happen again.”

- “Just finished lunch here. Despite some old negative reviews about food and atmosphere, we thought everything was just fine. Nice open sports bar environment. Large garage doors opened to the outside give the entire place an outdoor vibe. Pleasant service. Appropriately sports decorations and tables.  Reasonable prices.  Good beer selection, and the food was excellent.  JJ had the Reuben and took half it home l. I had the foot long kielbasa on a Kaiser roll served with excellent. fries. A Polish boy's dream lunch.  Ate it all. Please don't forward the picture to my cardiologist.   PS. We didn't see the waitress who wears almost nothing, as mentioned in Kelly B's earlier review. Darn it”
- “Best brat and burger in town. There are no big signs advertising this place but what a great place for lunch or dinner. All food is good.”
- “We ate here a lot . Wait staff very friendly . They even remembered what we like to drink. Everything on the menu is great. We've eaten here at least 15-20 times while in green valley . It's a come as you are type of place. They have great breakfast also.”

Everyone always takes their time to make sure you get exactly what you ask for! The salon is always clean, and no matter what time I've gone in, I always see the employees sweeping and cleaning their tools and stations! If you're looking for a place where people truly care about the work they're doing for you, come see Van and the rest of the team here at Eva Nails!”

Great service I am never disappointed, I would rather drive 45 minutes away and be happy with the final product than go somewhere else and pay money and be less than satisfied. Very clean and comfortable setting and superior services. I highly recommend.”

- “My sister and I went they said 5 min and they weren't packed and they left sharp edges on nails. Was the worst pedicure ever they don't know how to massage. My sister was waiting over an hour. They are unfriendly and they price gouged us. Not to mention they lied about wait time”
- “This place doesnt even deserve a 1 star. It was my first time there with my sister. We came in, and got pedicures. They gave us a menu, and picked out which package we want. Good thing we didnt go with any other package but the $25. We both had older men working on our feet. Usually when we go nail technicians would have conversations with us and sometimes even ask what our nationality is. This place didn't so we didnt think we should tell them. While getting our feet done, they gossip. One said my their hands are tired from removing the callus, and the other said shes dirty. That's so rude, but funny at the same time.  When we were done, sister didnt even want to tip her guy. Just a verbal tip, next time dont gossip. It's not nice. Couple days after, my heels hurt, it wasnt even smooth like other places would do it. This place SUCKS. Now that I see some pics of their full sets, glad I didn't get my nails done there. I know money is time,  but it would be nice for them to take some time on their clients and that will build a better relationship than to just rush it and move on.”
- “I would give no stars if possible.  Just came to get my eyebrows done, and she did one side freaking shorter than the other.   it's very obvious.    When I brought it up to her, she said it was shorter before...I know it wasn't bc I pluck my eyebrows every morning and leave them long.  This is ridiculous.   I look demented for my anniversary now...  Also, I felt rushed in and out like the other users have shared.   Will never return here and will tell all my friends.”

If you're here, read my review, look at the picture of my rash, THEN consider leaving. Luke is awesome. He always does a great job on my nails.

- “Food staff and restaurant manager Douglas were outstanding. You can tell all will be well when the manager is on the ball. Hope they keep up the generally excellent food and service of Denny's restaurants. Thank you all. God Bless.”
- “Stopped in here on my way to through AZ , I hadn't meant to but some bad directions, horrible road work and the late hour made it time to get off the road and take a break . I went in and it was quiet so I was seated right away. The waitress was very nice and I didn't have to wait long for my food. Here's where it got interesting .. every now and then you come across something or someone who is a diamond in the rough. I mean it's Denny's , it's not supposed to be some high end place with great food like you find in places that's you have to take out a second mortgage to eat at. To me Denny's has always been quick, good enough and filling. The young man doing the cooking is that's DITR I was talking about. I like my steaks medium well. One thing I have learned eating out is that most chefs have no idea how to make a medium well steak. You have to cook it enough that the outer part is done and the middle is pink but then ( here's where 99.99 percent get it wrong ) you have to know your temperatures well enough that the pink center will slowly brown as the steak rests allowing the flavor to seep into the pink and so you end up with a steak that is done , flavorful and not tough and chewy but not raw either. Almost no one ever gets it right. The chef here looks very young but he is good! The steak was perfect. One of the best I've had in a long long time. The rice was a little dry but it was late so that's expected at the end of the night. Kind of funny, the wild rice was mixed w something and none of us knew what it was ( me or the waitstaff) so one of the ladies googled it. They put quinoa in their rice. Not something I would have thought of , or probably ordered if I knew in advance but also very good . Overall  everything was good. My only complaint was it was freezing in there. I used to work across from a meat processing company, like the kind of place Rocky trained in, punching cow carcasses , and it was as cold as that place. My poor waitress was sniffling it was so cold. I would highly recommend you try this place before someone discovers the chef and whisks him off to Dallas or LA or gives him his own cooking show.”
- “We loved coming here on opening day! There was no opening day chaos or long wait for our food, as can sometimes be the case when a new restaurant opens. They seem to have it down AND are super friendly while doing so! All of our food was prepared well, correctly & was delicious!  Thank you, Denny's Rita Ranch! We can't wait to come back!”

- “Like raw chicken, this is the place, but not to worry the manager won't charge you for the chicken. This place was great when they opened, every visit since had been going down hill. Tonight everything was cold, I don't think the warming light was even on. Sad given how few restaurants we have out here anyway. Here's hoping my son is not sick all night. Stick with the grand slam.”
- “So this has been or 6th or 7th visit to this Denny's.  Worst service of our life tonight.  No one wanted to take responsibility for our table so we got no service.  One meal  great, the other garbage.  No one paying attention to anything and it looked like the manager kept going back to cook or expedite.  Hate it when places nearby drop so quickly in both quality and service.”
- “I have been here several times the food was good...so it overshadow the terrible service. But today we went in there and every single cup every single silverware was just disgusting dirty . The coffee cups had old coffee from the previous person that drank out of it. The water cups had what could only be describe as old milkshake on it. The Quality of this place has went way down quickly. We did end up walking out. Also there was 2 other tables that walk out as well. It was also a 20 min wait for just drinks. Will not be returning anytime soon.”

## Tips from customers
Don't order takeout or door dash. They will forget multiple items every time OK breakfast Food was cold

- “When you spend valuable time applying for Global Entry: SENTRI, TSA Pre-check, paid for the privilege and given a Known Traveler # - even verified by US Customs in person - wouldn't you think after almost two months I'd be able to use it.  However a very smart Alec TSA agent at a counter promoting such privilege mentioned that even though I've been back-ground checked, finger-printed and have paid - "that doesn't mean anything". Then why'd I waste my time and money? Is he serious?”
- “Been through many, many airports here and overseas and this TSA is the worst!  Rude, clearly undertrained and arrogant, the experience leaves you feeling like you walked into an Orwellian novel!  Clearly, most if these guys and gals were picked on in school and exhibit social graces that would make a cave dweller blush. Totally uncalled for and by exhibiting this kind of behavior they only add to the "Fun" that airline travel has become today. I especially liked the smirking, heavy set bald supervisor. A real class act. Better off driving to Phoenix.”

## Tips from customers
Usually easy and reasonable line, the lines can be long in the morning especially for the first flights out. Very important and unprofessional--like it was their first time.

- “Every time I go in here for a prescription I am told "oh, We just received it." It's almost their mantra. I'm here to tell you it's dishonest.   To test the system I stood next to my NP and watched her send my prescription. I then went to the grocery store    And ran an errand. I wasted 30 minutes then called Walgreens and the automated system said they were processing my scrip. I headed for this Walgreens and by the time I got there 45 - 60 minutes had passed total.   I walked up to the pharmacy and you know what they told me? You guessed it. " we just received it, just now".  I explained why that frustrated me and they said they would rush it but still took them 15 minutes while I had to hang out in the pharmacy with a sick kid.   So they are telling me that I can send an email to China in minutes but their dedicated prescription system takes an hour to receive a prescription from a doctor in the same neighborhood.   Lies!!!”
- “Don't even bother going to the "walk in" clinic unless u have an appointment. I went and signed in and kiosk said I was number 2 on the list. After waiting for half an hour the nurse practitioner came out and told me all her slots were full with appts. I told her it said I was number 2 in line and she informed me I was now listed as #6 and she doubted she would be able to see me. CVS has a true walk in and I am the only one In the que”

Today I was trying to  get my meds and had this younger girl asking me why I take this? I was also told thAt the manager wanted to speak to my doctor and thought I should take a stronger dose of  my extended so he won't fill them til he speaks to him  but he won't be back at work for 3 days.  First,  it's none oF there business why I take these meds and felt very uncomfortable.  Second, the manager is nOt my doctor if I wanted him as my dOctor I would hire him.  Don't they think that  my doc and I already discussed  what  treatment plan will work best for me!!!  I struggle everyday to even get out of bed . I wish I wasn't sick . I'm actually disabled.  However there is one lady named Teresa who is very Sweet and apologized for the younger girl asking me questions about mY conditions.  Long story short  go elsewhere unless you want to be judged I ended up going elsewhere with no problems.  Lost my business”

## Tips from customers
Really incompetent people at the pharmacy. If I were you I would read your prescription before you leave to make sure you have the right prescription at the right dose. Not only did they not do that the bag was stapled and they just handed me the bag. The medicine was prescribed to someone else and it was not the same that I was supposed to be getting Very impressed with the cleanliness of the store and how nice the employees are! Great selection

It's a very quiet property - very important to me, close to everything I needed (Trader Joe's, Rillito for running, Union Public House, the University). Neighbors and management were always very friendly. I got lucky with a north facing view of the gorgeous Catalina's. Gated was a big plus for me as well. Wouldn't hesitate to live here again.”

Basically took white glove to check to see the cleanliness. Gave them keys etc. All is was well. Now that am looking for new place I have some freaking Eviction on my credit. Funny Mngr. Was friendly and all we shook hand and they labeled me as being evicted!!! Fight not over very disappointed basically manager sucks to hold up to there end”
- “The short of the bad stuff you're probably wondering about -- the A/C went out for months and it took just as long for them to fix it despite the legal implications in Arizona, hot water goes out ever 4-6 months and takes up to 3 days to fix, pool was out of commission for months upon my move out, shrubs are overgrown and scratch cars. My own car was hit in the parking lot and the "security" cameras were so poor they couldn't get the plate and it took months of emailing and going to the property manager to fix the problem because she wasn't responding to all of the insurance's emails.  The longer details:  I lived here for over 2 years as a graduate student. It was affordable and gated and I completely regret thinking those things meant anything good for my time or stress level. In the beginning, the property manager Margaret was attentive and handled maintenance issues quickly. In the summer of 2017, the complex's A/C started to go out. The owner did not address the issue until 2-3 months in when the entire complex's (including property manager's office) A/C went out. Despite A/C being a legal requirement in Arizona, the complex took advantage of all residents -- including elderly and cancer PTs visiting Tucson for chemotherapy -- and did not refund the entire amount legally due to residents for all of the days without A/C.  I had good rapport with Margaret. She appreciated that I didn't wear shoes in my apartment and kept the space clean. I notified her about maintenance issues promptly and always paid my rent on time. Upon moving out, I gave my notice 2 days "late". I asked Margaret if she could waive the 2 days considering the numerous maintenance issues that were outstanding on my unit despite several appointments being made for 9 months (dripping, noisy faucet; bulbs gone out) and me calling and emailing several times. She said she would look into it. I had to remind her several times and she ultimately never emailed me back after saying that she would several times.   I received a partial security deposit past the date which the contract promised it to me and without any prior courtesy notice of claimed "damages" nor with any email from Margaret confirming the matter about the rent. I even had to email to get the security deposit. She charged me for the 2 days, an extra fee for going "month-to month" for 2 days, and a fee for claimed damages in the walls -- I hung up 1 mirror and 1 shelf.   Ultimately, this is a terrible place to live for anyone. Your time will be wasted trying to track down an overworked and disorganized property manager. The complex owner has no regard for the human beings on the property. Maintenance is horrendous and does not arrive for appointments. I know it seems like a steal to have utilities included with the rent and have it be gated, but you will be sorely disappointed to not spent $200 more per month and live somewhere that will better meet your needs.   Real talk: take out a bit more loans if you're a student, ask someone for help with the rent, get a roommate or work an extra shift if you need to.   This is an embarrassment of an apartment complex and the people who run it will ultimately screw you over with a smile.”

The set up can be tricky for those who are unfamiliar with the process but you go in and grab one of the slips (whichever one has what you want on it-some slips are for plain bagels, some slips are for breakfast bagels, lunch bagels, signature bagels, you get the idea) then you put your name on that and toss it in a little cubby! The workers behind the glass then grab your slip and make your food and call your name when it's Time to go to the register and pay.

Never got that level of personal service with Wells Fargo.  Last Friday I totaled my car.  Today, I went to deposit the settlement check.  Now, I need this money so I can give up the rental, and make a down payment on a new vehicle.  Because of the amount of the check,  there's an automatic 7 business day hold.   Uh oh. ..this immediately stresses me out.  15 minutes later, Nichole lets me know that the teller had spoken with her, she knew my circumstances,  and the check was clear.

Anything you do at this bank they charge you, no matter if you have a loan or not. Today I walk in and there was 12 people ahead of me, and two lanes open.

Each person that we talked to at the credit union said it was cleared up. They  made mistake after mistake. All we needed was the IRA to go from my dad to my mom. IT TOOK ONE YEAR!!  My parents were with them for about 30 years. It was a lot of undue stress on my mom and us siblings.   I was NOT happy with them at all. I was very disappointed.”

They have no clue how their establishment works...at all! I would absolutely never, ever, use this place again if I have a choice. This was a vehicle loan and my first time with a credit union as well. Really solidified my opinion of credit unions in general. For such a small organization there super inefficient, charge you for everything and their technology is super antiquated. their website is subpar and their app is a waste of time. Both offer minimal features and almost require an in person visit to the under staffed locations to wait in line for an excessive amount of time.”

- “Fantastic! Express really took the time to figure out what would be best for me and guided me through the process of everything I would need to do for my best possible position. Cate and Wendy are great, and they don't make you feel like a number. If you want to be a substitute teacher or find any other job, I would recommend Express as your first stop.”
- “This is a great company. I am currently working as a substitute teacher and can say I am perfectly happy with how I am able to pick and choose jobs through Express. I choose the schools where I want to work and if something happens and I am unhappy, Cate, at Express, is immediately available with support. I love that they pay weekly and the pay is always on time and the amount is correct. I highly recommend this company to others who may want a flexible schedule. I took a full time teaching job for seven months to replace a teacher who went on leave and never returned to the classroom and always felt I could rely on Express for support.”

- “Horrible agency to work with. Thankfully there are several employment solutions in the area. The owner was rude and treated the office employees extremely rude in front of clients. I can only imagine how she treats her staff behind doors. The workers she would send to us, didn't show up for work more than 75% of the time. I would highly recommend the owner learn to train her staffing agents on the basics of interviewing, rather than looking for bodies who can pass a drug test. Not to mention a training on how to create a positive and uplifting culture in the work place. As a woman myself it was really sad to see the owner talking down to her staff of women. I could literally hear her yelling and cursing at the staff. I will never go back Express ever and would recommend no else does either.”

- “I want to give a HUGE shoutout to this Dunkin Doughnuts location for supporting their local law enforcement and their community. They were a great sponsor for Probation, Parole, and Pretrial appreciation week and they provided the departments with excellent customer service.  From personally visiting the facility, I was greeted by friendly staff and a one of the cleanest Dunkin Doughnuts establishments I've seen in Tucson.  I highly recommend this location. It's the best Dunkin Doughnuts in town!”

- “This location I have visited 3 times, each time a complete disappointment. First visit the young lady dropped all my sweet tea, no lemon.  The second time my husband got sick from eating a breakfast sandwich and my last visit was today 3/19/21- I did a mobile order to expect to pick up my order on the way to work, once arrived the drive thru was extremely long so I decided to go in; worst mistake ever.  I arrive at the mobile pick up area and the young lady work around 7:50 a.m.  did not greet me nor asked if she could help.  She continued making a drink, completely ignored.  I attempted 2 hello's to acknowledge my presence she heard me on the 2sd.  I advised her I was there to pick up a mobile order and she replied just one moment and looked at my ticket then went To get another girl in the back and stated she is making my drink now, my drink was made and yet again no lemons.  I am completely dissatisfied with this locations customer service and lack thereof.”
- “This dunkin donuts is seriously a joke. They never ever made my coffee right in the drive thru so I thought .aubergine going inside would make them try harder and not mess up, sadly I was wrong. I never get the coffee I order here. The staff is sassy and rude, a tad trashy but that's a bit rude. The lobby is never clean and the tables are almost never wiped down.”
- “I had a long day and was craving the flavor of the ice coffee with cream sugar and Carmel.,. My to-go spot, on Campbell had to much construction and traffic, I decided to Google the nearest dunkin to my location. This one popped up. When you drive up to order, you can barely hear the person taking your order, which makes it hard to order. When I finally got my order taken, and drove up to the window, I waited over 5 minutes before anyone even greeted me at the window. Yet, I could see people going in and out of the back door through my rear view, and could see the cars backing up behind me.  Finally after 8 minutes getting my order taken, I got the drink I wanted. So I thought!!!! Carmel!!!  Where was the Carmel!? I was charged for it, but it was not in my coffee. And trust me, I know how the coffee taste, with Carmel in it.  I'm a regular at the other dunkin. I could've turned around and got what I ordered, but why!? Customer service sucked, and the lines were huge! Big waste of my time and money....that being said, ill find a way around the construction on Campbell, since they rock with customer service and get people in and out! Im Very disappointed, and will not be returning to this location no matter what!!!!!”

## Tips from customers
Good coffee at 5:30pm. Bathroom is clean, possibly because you need to ask the staff for the code. Sausage egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on Texas toast!!!!! This location won't take the coupon on the bottom of your receipt from another location Mmm Boston cream! Apparently they only have 1 person working took to long won't come back Closed for remodeling! Have your employees take their smoke breaks when you are NOT busy. Thanks. The line is always a few cars long between 7:45 and 8:15. So plan ahead! Heart-shaped donuts?  Yes please! Speed of service depends on who's in the kitchen. The best hot caramel macchiato I've had thus far though. Nicest people work here. They should go train Starbucks on customer service! Wish all Dunkins looked like this location. Dunkachino is heaven on earth! Good, just too small of a serving. Try this here: a chocolate glazed donut, a couple of scoops of vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, & whipped cream Snickers ice cream! The best donuts and great coffee!! Good coffee Employees here are rude and it's like u inconvenience them !!! 25 minute wait at the drive thru made me update to 3 stars. They have Fox News on in the lobby... GROSS Marble glazed rock! Come donate gifts for kiddos in group homes! 0-18 years. Dunkin Donuts at Grant and Swan! Employee was rude and short with us...and they charge for water, and don't tell you. Go to Krispy Kreme instead The overnight worker, Deborah, is the best!

He said that he did paperwork for me and was upset that I wanted to see if I could get a lower interest rate with Pima Federal Credit Union. I guess he felt I owed him for making a presentation to me.”
- “Vip Mortgage is very unprofessional.  I contacted VIP for some information regarding a loan.  2 days later I called for some information about the loan. Matt was the person I initially spoke with.  I followed up on Friday again to find out the status of my loan. Matt's excuse was he transposed my number and tried to follow up.  I had texted Mattt previously so He had my correct number.  Use someone else if you need a mortgage.  If you need a smaller mortgage this company could care less about you! Thomas Bader and Matt ,unfortunately I dont have his last name any longer, were the sales reps I spoke with.”

- “We're shopping for pavers to extend the patio and block for a wall. They have a huge selection of both. The staff is really helpful and knowledgeable.”
- “"AZ Block 2000" was the name of this paver manufacturer until Quikrete bought the facility five years ago and changed the name to "AZ Best Block." I was very satisfied with the pavers nine years ago and I am told that the manufacturing process has not changed with the new owners.  The "tumbled" pavers are very attractive and give a worn appearance to the final project. See my photo titled "20081115 Patio Paver Random Pattern from AZ Block 2000" for an example of my random placement design.  There are no retail outlets for these pavers in the Tucson area, so you will not see them in any local Big Box Store. You will have to visit the manufacturing site just south of Twin Peaks Rd on the the I10 access road to see and buy these cement pavers (or drive to Phoenix).  I plan to use another 200 Sq Ft of these pavers in the near future.”

- “I have been buying block from them for over 20 years. The last couple of years when they run out of the type of block I buy, I have been told I can buy block from someplace else. When stating I want the color to match, I am told it will probably be pretty close in color some place else. When asked when they will make more I am told that while it is a stock item it is a slow mover. The signage on their building says open to the public. It is not really. I need to have one of their people come out and look at my project. Office staff over the years has been excellent. No longer the case. After three months, I had to ask for my money back. I work hard for my earnings. I will now take my business some place where it is appreciated. After reading other reviews, it seems I am not alone”
- “I have a 3600 SQ. Ft. Building that I started in mid Jan. 2018, we picked out the slump block at that time, The color was perfect for what we wanted, I paid for the block shortly after in feb. and contractor picked up a few pallets for the stem wall, after stem was laid up we still have three pallets of block left, we were told block would be here in two weeks then we were told three weeks then 5 weeks now 7 or 8 weeks. I talked with salesman he assured me it wasn't the contractors fault, his company assumed all responsibility, I'm glad we established that admission, I wouldn't want to go after my contractor without him being responsible. We feel we are being held hostage, if we buy block form different manufacturer the color is way different than what has been laid up and will look like garbage. I would not have given them one star but that option wasn't available. We just want what we paid for, at this point we are considering legal action to get what is ours. I will be glad to adjust my comments according to our satisfaction of complaint.”

- “I was doubtful after reading the terrible reviews this place hd, but I was bored of Wingstop. This place BLEW me away. The wings were big and crispy, more than generously seasoned, and the onion rings were sooo good. Only complaint is that I got an extra ranch instead of special sauce on the side, I'm looking forward to trying it in my next order. I had a really good experience here.”
- “Good place for boneless wings. Fries are awesome. Atomic hot wing are good as well. Fries with chicken are even better.”
- “This place is bomb. Even though it's a wing place, their salad is very fresh and delicious (along with the wings). They also have the option of boneless wings, which I don't usually like, but I love them here! They are crispy and juicy and full of flavor. I absolutely love their fries--no one makes fries like those anymore. And then there's their specialty: buffalo fries. Fries with chicken bites and sauce on top--so good. Bravo buffalo spot.”

- “Check out literally any other chicken spot in town. Quality and service has been decreasing HORRIBLY. Took an hour to get food. Employees were rude, when confronting them about the HOUR wait for fast food they simply responded with "short staffed". Don't come here, I certainly never will. Also the drink machine sucks and leaks all over your hand.”
- “Spot it usually spot on! Ordered 15 boneless wings half pineapple jalapeño and tajin. Waited almost 20 minutes for my order and when I got home my wings we're barely sauced and my the chicken was overcooked. Very disappointed and will highly recommend somewhere else if you want wings.”

## Tips from customers
We ordered boneless wings could not finish the 1st wing I had was not cooked al Great service. Easily my favor wings in Tucson A regular size is a huge portion, so the small would probably fill you unless you are really hungry Meh. Delicious wings Delicious! A large fry covered in buffalo wings is enough to feed 3 people Amazing food & great service. Took my order to go and I was in and out in 5 minutes.

- “Dr. Vig took care of my Grandmother and must have done a very good job, as she died at age 99.  I have gone to Dr. Vig for the past 15 years and he has solved all my health problems.  He has sent me to different Dr. to solve problems that are out of his practice.  Thank you Dr. Vig.”
- “Dr. Vig is great! I've seen him for years. He is warm, direct and has great bedside manor. He helped diagnose a problem and found the prognosis that 4 other physicians and 3 specialist couldn't, over a 10 year time period. He is in early in the morning and stays late. He takes his profession serious and helps the patient instead of being talked down to and dismissing concerns like so many others. My grandmother saw him and she recommended him to me after he became her favorite physician too. I recommended him to many friends and even my mother. As long as I'm in Tucson I will see him! If you're tired of trying to find a physician who cares and who works hard in his practice, you should definitely see him. You'll be glad you did!!”
- “I can't really speak on the other reviews except to say, Dr. Vig specializes in internal/family medicine...not orthopaedics etc.., so to place the blame on him for not diagnosing a torn rotator cuff and torn bicep...utter nonsense.  Simple internet search will show you that what he recommended, is in fact inline with the treatment of such an injury.  Secondly, surgeons...well, they make they're money from surgery.  So of course they're going to want you to come to them first.  (How many surgeons make money from needless surgeries?)  So, don't blame Steven Vig for the arrogance of your surgeon.    And unless V S. is also a physician, I'd try to stay away from playing armchair physician.    Not every Dr. is perfect for every patient.  It takes time to find that Dr. that makes you feel at  ease, and to find that Dr. that does in fact listen to you, and give you a proper treatment plan.  I've been a patient of Dr. Vig's for many years now, and have been more than satisfied, and would continue to recommend him to others....actually, that's difficult to do, because it increases his patient load, and in turn makes it more difficult to get in right away.”

We ended up at the hospital for over 12 hours after my mothers oncologist caught the mistake. Dr. Vig's office is horrible. I would advise to never go there.”
- “Went to him for years. He is not a very good Dr.  Complained about shoulder pain. His only suggestion to change my exercise routine. Later I found out I had a torn rotator and a torn bicep. The orthopedic surgeon said  you should have come to me years sooner and your out come from this surgery would have been better. Not very competent Dr.would never recommend him to anyone. He even conducts annual physicals with out having patients disrobe and checking for anything.  How can you do a physical just by looking at a patient. If you want quality medical care don't see him. I know he is not a orthopedic surgeon, but when medical conditions are beyond your scope of practice. A good Doctor would refer you to a specialist. He didn't even do that.”

The manager, Brian Buffard, is NOT understanding Federal Law for Americans with Disabilities and the use of TRAINED service dogs; this establishment is acting in violation of Federal Laws and Arizona Laws. This restaurant demanded that we show our dog's registration. There is no such thing! When we tried to explain that there is no such thing the waitress got very upset with us and accused us of being liars. She then accused us of getting angry!!! She said she called her manager, Brian, and he said we needed to get out! No 100% disabled veteran should be treated badly when they enter any public place with their trained service dog. To all Veteran's of Foreign Wars, DAV, active duty military, and any veteran please inform other veterans that this place is not veteran friendly. If we could give them a zero we would...btw there were no patrons in the restaurant area. All we did was walk in and ask if they were serving!! The waitress then got so aggressive and wouldn't even listen to us that there is no such thing as a registered service dog. We then tried to show the card that the service dog wears stating Federal Laws, and she would not even look at it. She said we could have printed it up!!! A bouncer/cook guy came out and I showed him. When the waitress kept up her verbal attack on us, he turned with her and walked away. What terrible customer service and it is no wonder they have no customers. We are making a Federal complaint and hopefully they will learn the law of our Nation regarding service dogs that help our Nation's Veterans.”

- “This place is in front of a laundromat, so while my clothes were in the dryer I dropped in for lunch. I ordered the BBQ beef sandwich with onion rings ($9.39 plus tax and tip). It sucked. The BBQ sauce was awful, the bun was soggy from the sauce, and the onion rings weren't very good either. There's not much to say about the run-down sports bar decor. Service was slow at times even though the place was almost empty. I may use that laundromat again, but I won't return here.”

Way cool and very fun dive bar. I believe I was swimming in a pond of Ex's, not mine but everyone else. I. Am. Not. Sober. Surprisingly good Friday all you can eat fish and chips. Worst food I have ever eaten!  Won't try it again. Very rude staff. I'll not return, based on that. Best water in town Great place for a fun night out

The first time I was informed they don't sell food until after 11 am... open at 9 am. They have bulk items listed on the menu and a cooler with what appeared to be such items, I inquired if I could purchase some of them and was promptly reminded... no food til 11. This morning I had just dropped off my daughter at school and was driving by, saw the front door wide open and thought " warm tortillas". Upon walking in the store was greeted with a shout of " We're Closed" not good morning or how are you. I asked if I could purchase some of the tortillas on the counter and was then informed they were just preparing the food for later... I can understand if your busy or closed... but no excuse for being Dicks... and both times I've been there they've been Dicks.”
- “I enjoyed there tortillas until I found out how unsanitary they are.  I heard them talk to their employees like legit trash. I was so shock that I will never step foot in there again. they need to get a grip & act like a professional "company"”
- “I bought tortillas here a few times and decided to try the food today. What a disappointment!   We had the red beef tamales combo ($7.25) and the chicken tacos combo ($6). The kitchen took the tamales and chicken fillings out of the fridge and stick them to a microwave. Granted, both of them were made in house, but they were made a while ago so it wasn't fresh. The microwave thing totally killed it. The rice and beans were flavorless. I'd rather go to Nico's, Paco's, and one of those "bertos" places for quick Mexican.”

Today they wouldn't accept the coupon we had from the Save Around book that we buy to support our local schools.  The reason....it didn't have a barcode.  I can understand why these stores aren't surviving in Tucson because the employees do not know what they are doing.  First we can straight up show them the previous coupons we have used that do not have barcodes and were honored with no issue.  We can pull up the coupons on the app for the Save Around but they can't take those without a barcode.  Why wasn't it an issue the last 3 times?  Needless to say, we will not be back.  It's to far to drive for rude team members who do not know what they are doing.  Needless to say, we ate somewhere else.”
- “EEK is right! I haven't been here for a while but am so disappointed as many others now. I went past here and planned on getting the taco salad for it's famous fluffy, crunchy shell. NOPE, I went through drive thru and the guy there said the total was $5 and change for this and 3 flatbread chicken tacos?? He repeated this total again at the window and I questioned it and he said, I meant $15(and change). I thought the bag for the taco salad was strangely small. No shell, just a few chips beside the lettuce and blah on the salad plus 3 sliced browning avocados. Yuk. I pulled around to the parking lot and went in. I asked for 2 flatbread steak tacos instead and may not return to Del Taco again unless the salad is made the same way as before again. I explained to the guy that took my order I wasn't going to eat that crap and he said they are getting this reaction from a lot of people. He graciously gave me the steak flatbreads instead. They were only .01 difference in price too getting 2 of those at 2.79+tax.”

## Tips from customers

John was incredible - always available, patient, knowledgeable and assuring.  As for the demo and install, the teams where always on time, quick, and respectful of our home.

I think they're terrific.  Another company I called couldn't even send someone out to give me a quote for 3 weeks.”
- “I have used Sunrise Irrigation for over 10 years and the service has always been reliable, swift, and very courteous.  This last week Lindy and Tom outdid themselves.  I had a waterline leak that was close to the irrigation line.  Tom came out to verify that it was not the irrigation line.  He came after a full day of work on the other side of town.   Lindy, Sunrise Irrigation's office manager, helped me to navigate the process of getting the main water line repaired.  Tom returned yesterday to fix the irrigation shut off that I had accidentally broken.  Tom is exceptionally knowledgeable about irrigation and a clever problem solver.  Lindy's advice saved me hundreds of dollars.  Both go beyond what is expected.  If you are looking for honest, knowledgeable, responsible and responsive attention to your irrigation and plumbing challenges, I sincerely recommend Sunrise Irrigation.”

- “Ordered by phone for curbside pickup. Paid with credit card. They said be there in 15-20 minutes and pizza will be ready.  I arrived at Domino's Pizza in 15 minutes and parked right in front of the window. They looked directly at me. I waited additional 15 minutes. People came and went with their pizza. Delivery people left in their cars with pizza. Finally, after 35 minutes, I got out of my car, went to the door and waved to get attention for someone to come out. The door is locked and they do not offer dine-in service or counter service due to Covid-19. When the manager Josh came to the door, I told him that I had been waiting for a pizza ordered and paid for over 30 minutes ago. Where is it? He went back inside looked around, then came out and told me he had no record of the order. Then, he said "I see we forgot to make it." and "They are just now stretching the dough, ...it will be an additional 20 minutes." This was outrageous. I asked for a refund, which I cheerfully received. What a waste of time. I will never go to Domino's again and I will tell everyone I know to stay away from this Domino's location.”
- “This little hole in the wall excuse for a dominos is the worst! Aside from the fact that it's the size of my kitchen the workers there are awful! They don't give you water, even if you literally faint inside of the store!!! They just watch you crawl to a seat to help yourself up and then walk to the back and pretend it never happened. Needless to say I will be taking my business to Pizza Hut. They are absolutely fabulous and nothing like that old out dated, shady, inconsiderate, dry and crusty pizza joint.”

They also have a huge selection of chicken wing sauces that are truly mild to truly spicy”
- “Spectacular tacos.  I hate to say it but I didn't get a picture because I care them instead.  I had the chicken tacos at Mulligan's today and they were delicious.  I asked for flour tortillas and the  showed up with a crispy brown edge.  Upon further inspection I realized that the crispy brown edge was yummy cheese.  The taco was flavorful and the melted cheese on the tortillas gave them structural stability.”

- “If I could I would give 0 stars. The place was recommended to me that their food was delicious me and my boyfriend arrived at the door The lady yelled at us "you can sit where you want" and everybody turned their heads to look at us so we headed out back to a flooded run down crappy patio.  We sat there and waited for 25 minutes with the sprinklers dripping down on our table and our server didn't even come out yet to get drinks, welcome us or anything. After waiting for 30 minutes we walked back inside and there were 2 waiters sitting around talking to each other. Laughing. Please get better staff. I have never had to walk out of a restaurant before.”
- “Poor service!  We went for the Friday fish fry. Took a long time to get anything. Petite blonde waitress didn't listen to anything that was asked and she didn't allow time to ask for anything. We were a party of 4, she bought 2 napkins an a single fork. We asked repeatedly for silverware, she delivered them 1 by 1 half way through the meal. The drinks had too much ice and the soda was flat. We waited for her to return with the bill, she took a long time. My husband got tired of waiting for her to return, so he approached the bar. The lady (blonde) behind the bar waved him off and went to the other side of the bar. He was left standing there.    The service turned me off completely. The bill came out close to $70. $70 for a strange dining experience. Don't waste your time. Go to Jeff's Pub. This was my 1st and last time at Mulligans.”
- “I was referred here to a couple of friends for their Chicken wing special on Wednesday nights. I took my family there for dinner. We ordered soft drinks and water. ( I had just drank a large drink before I got there). We ordered 3 burger plates and a cheese quesadilla. I wanted the wing special. I was told I would have to order a beverage. I did not want a beverage. we had already ordered 2 other beverages. They would not let me get the special. I was told "no way" I asked if my daughter who had a beverage could order them and we were told she would be the only one to eat them. I then ordered onion rings then switched to the fries. I was brought the onion rings. No apology. she switched out for the fries. the waitresses are not accommodating nor are they personable. It is like they are "Just there". My bill was $47 for this and I still could not get the wing special. They have lost a customer as I will not be returning and the reviews I will give this place to other possible patrons will not be positive.  Don't expect be be treated like a customer here”

## Tips from customers
These guys have the best lemon pepper wings in town. Best burgers in town! Christmas Intervention Show with "Still Here" & Tora! Where are you?! The wings and fries are really good. Wings are meaty. Dinner with my sweetheart.  :) Best Bar on the Eastside! I managed to get a picture of the tacos before eating them this time.  Delicious! Swee potato fries here I come! Great place to stop for a beer after you've been out to wind down and chill. I'm not the only who has been complaining about their slimey food... Exercise caution. Colin just brought me a pitcher of iced tea. Smart waiter. :) Went there on wing night. The wings were slimy and the service was very slow. Here for a really big rock show. And a burger. And beer. But primarily, music. The BEST wings and the service from everyone is always great! Best burger menu in town. Game 7 on the TV out in the patio no less. I Love Tucson Great burgers and wings. Nice beer selection too. I'm sitting in mulligans now.  Recently, they downgraded their menu from a four page book to a one page flyer.  Every entree on their new "menu" is sold out.  They have a great selection of pizza... Which they're also sold out of.  They are also out of cheddar cheese to top a normal cheeseburger.  I wouldn't recommend this place, except for the fact that the wait staff may be one of the nicest in the city.  My tip: go for drinks, not food. Great service cold cold beer  fries where perfect!

- “We visited Sunday at around 2pm  Our experience didn't start off so great. Our party of 6 was seated, and were left waiting for at least 15 minutes for anyone to follow up with us on drinks or anything. We finally got someone's attention and they apologized as their communication was off.   After we ordered drinks and food  (as we had waited a long enough time to decide what to eat) the manager came over to apologize and offered us an appetizer on the house. This was much appreciated because most restaurants wouldn't do something like that.   As far as the food, everything was very good and came out to us super quick even tho it wasn't too busy. We ordered the clam chowder (a little salty but good), the lobster Mac n cheese, the (2) Admiral's feast (the fried scallops were tiny and the fried lobster was also small and mostly breading) bit it comes with a salad and a side which was definitely a feast. Oh and of course, the appetizer was on point. It included 4 cooked plain shrimp served on ice, 4 stuffed cheese mushrooms, and 4 coconut shrimp. We also ordered strawberry and peach lemonades which were super good and refreshing. Not too sweet either.   Overall, our service was fantastic! Thank you, we'll be back.”
- “Arrived on Friday right between the lunch and dinner crowds and was immediately able to get a table for two. They have a lot of new weekday deals that I hadn't know about. But we were glad to find them! My mother and I both had the jumbo coconut shrimp and were in love with it. Entrees come with the cheddar bay biscuits (why we really come here!) and a salad. Our server was amazing. Food was amazing.   The table right behind us was terrible though! The woman began complaining that her fried fish "didn't look like the picture" and her very, very attentive server asked her if she'd like them to fry up a new piece. The patron said no. But later she asked to speak to the manager. This patron proceeds to tell the manager that she isn't happy because the fish doesn't look exactly like the picture--everyone, be advised those are professional photos and fish may vary a bit!--and then begins to tell lies about the server. She says the server "blew her off" which was 100% not true. The manager handles this with the upmost dignity and offers to make a fish-fry-to-go for the woman. She then says "well we were also going to order chicken tenders to go." Yikes! The manager ends up giving them a free fish and chips as well as a free chicken tenders kids meal to go. What the hell? The food is "awful" yet you're going to take two more dishes home?!   I asked my server to call the manager over once the table left, and then told the manager that her server had indeed been wonderful and had offered the table a piece of extra fish already. I couldn't live with myself had that server gotten in trouble for this lady's lies. Luckily, the manager realized that the angry patron really just wanted to get two free kids meals to take home, and knew the server had done all she could.   Five star experience at my table. Five stars for how this manager and server dealt with a ridiculously picky (and I would say 'scammer') patron. I'll definitely support this place again.”
- “We often stop for late lunch (1:30 - 2:00 PM) at this Red Lobster when returning from Tucson shopping, appointments, etc.  We are always recognized as repeat customers by the welcoming hostess and have received great food and even greater service from our phenom waiter, Eric.  We've never experienced a long wait as I read in other reviews -- we enjoy dining off peak times as it is always quieter and the staff usually doesn't have so many tables to serve.  Waits aren't necessarily a bad thing -- that means the place is popular!  The fresh fish has always been excellent and the wood grilled tacos awesome.  Looking forward to a visit next week to try the Crabfest menu!”

- “45 minutes a waste of time trying to order delivery through Red Lobster.com. Unsuccessful in three out of the last four attempts for the  free promotion for free delivery through Red Lobster.com through 12/22. Got an error message at check out this time. Spoke to the call center and Amber the manager of the Scottsdale location who couldn't help and said it was a corporate issue. Red lobster is clearly unable to handle deliveries and have no one to help with issures. Terrible customer service.”
- “Don't order anything with Alfredo sauce.  Had the Shrimp Alfredo - absolutely no taste, bland, shrimp felt rubbery and old.  The only thing good was the biscuits and they were a tad underdone.  How can a super Red Lobster that we patronized weekly in Aurora, Illinois suffer so badly when done in Tucson, Arizona.  If someone gives me gift cards for this restaurant, I will throw them away.”
- “I wouldn't know what the food taste like at this location, I sat for 10 mins watching 4 waiters walk past me without getting any acknowledgement or even a glass of water on a 100+ degree day in August, so I left and went to the Native New Yorker. They had like 15 people tops in the restaurant and like 5 waiters, just walking around trying to look cute, like they were on a runway. Smh... I'll drive another 45mins to the east side next time I want to buy an Ultimate Feast.”

## Tips from customers
Always great food, had good service. My Mother's Day dinner ala Don! We love it here.  Good food & good service You can get a four course meal for fifteen bucks Lobster pizza & bahama mamma Server was super friendly and the garlic grilled shrimp was excellent Our waitress Jovanna was the best. She did a fantastic job. Good service and food.  Well worth the experience. Thank you

- “I was in Tucson for a few weeks and I stumbled upon this shop. I travel a lot and always try different vapes from different shops. I have NEVER tasted juices this good before. I purchased My Melons and Express Joe and I was so impressed that I bought the biggest bottles they had. Unfortunately for me, TSA confiscated my bottles before hopping on a plane. I have not been able to find juice as smooth and with such amazing flavor as I found here. I'm now in Virginia and just had to order those 2 juices over the phone because I just can't find anything as good. The prices are AMAZING too. This shop is all around amazing and the employees are incredibly helpful, patient and kind. If I was still in Tucson I would be here all the time. For now I will be ordering over the phone from them. I HIGHLY recommend. 10/10”
- “I wasn't surprised to see they have 5 stars!! I am always pleased with the staff's service! Recently came into the shop with a broken piece and got an amazing deal and amazing service,  I wish I remember his name! Great location and environment as well!”
- “The staff here are great.  I came originally to try out and buy juice.  The sales associate helped me out and took a look at my setup.  My old kangertech tank was starting to fall apart and he suggested me a newer subtank since I was running a mod setup.  Everything was explained and also offered to go through the steps of rebuilding my own wick and coil setup from the subtank.”

- “IIegal activity here!!!  Im done with place. It looks nice inside but looks will fool you. I have been going for at least a year and a half and its Going so poorly now, im just done. They never have the juice that kept me here anymore. The new crew they have hired allow thier friends to hang out all day and deal weed in front and out of the store. VERY ILLEGAL by the way. And these guys done care about customer when they have all thier friends in the shop (as many as five or so) and i know when the guy working behind the glass desk tells his friend "hit me up in like an hour and i will get you that shit) means ok.  I see money and weed palm passes each time i am here. This is bullshit. I should feel safe here that im not going to get caught up in a rade or some crap. After so long of see'n this i have half a mind to tip off authorities.”
- “I was at a store next to this shop and knew I needed a new coil, so I decided to stop by. I was not sure of the kind but knew it was super common as it came with a common generic vape. I told them what I had and they had no idea what I was talking about. I had to walk around and show them the vape. Even after that they had no idea, I pointed a coil out and told them I think that was it. After inspecting it I knew it was the right one and paid for it. I then asked about their prices. The girl behind the counter just looked at me, then looked at the bottles to my left that I could see they had prices on. Not even an oz of customer service. I picked a small bottle to try, paid and took it home. The customer service here is absolutely horrible, if the girls hate there job please, just find a new one.  Now to the juice review, this was supposed to be a fruit loops, and it taste nothing like that at all! It is smooth, but that's about it. I would avoid this location if you have a choice! I think the girls working would rather have you avoid it as well, it interrupts their personal vape time!”

Your manager Carissa is a HOE. Terrible customer service. This place sucks. Place is awesome, girls are vary helpful and polite. In & out service

I've used this store for shipping and have always been very satisfied, but this was the first time I'd used the notary service. All the staff were wearing masks, and there is always a friendly and professional vibe at this location.”
- “These guys are the BEST!  We are trying to do a double-refinance and needed get about 50 pages off to the mortgage company. Seemed as though faxing  was the way to go (better then doing the impossible and figuring out how to use the home scanner). Went to Fedex Kinkos resigned to paying $2 a page. But the fellow at the desk said it'd take 15 mins. to even take our order. Yelp showed this nearby UPS Shop where it would cost only $1 a page.  The nice young gal at UPS said instead of faxing she'd scan it all attaching it to an email to the broker and us--saving us about $30! Our awful ordeal was made just a bit better thanks to the good people at the UPS Store--even though they were very busy.”

- “So being a Chicagoan I can only say this is just one experience in one day at this store.  I brought some items in that needed to be sent to chicago. Items were packed at store with employees help. I was very surprised when after a week no package was delivered. Was told box was damaged and sent back to Tucson store. Never received a call from store notifying me and when I called and asked what happens next I was told they are waiting to hear back from ups. I have gotten excuse after excuse. Bottom line I spent $42.00 for a package that never arrived and got a lot of attitude about how it's not their responsibility and they will do nothing. I hope the $42 dollars was worth this review.  Only one experience but in the future I will be going to fed ex”
- “Awful customer service! I called to see if they had notary services available and I was told yes.  I advised the woman on the phone that I would head right over. When I got there the woman that I talked to on the phone went in a back office and was advised by the notary that she was too busy and couldn't do it at that time without a wait.  You have no customer you are working with but you're too busy to help people who are actually at your establishment for your services? Ridiculous! What a blatant disregard for your customers!”
- “Overall poor service.  Just go to another location if you really want your package to arrive at its destination.  No accountability if something goes wrong with your UPS shipment.”

- “If you love your pet, don't take them here. Read the rest of the negative reviews because I bet they're all true after the experience I had. I read them but decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt because it's the only vet inside my pet insurance network on the eastside. This vet clinic is absurdly unprofessional and I will not be returning. If I could give negative stars I would.  Right off the bat when I called to make my appointment, I was not impressed with the man, whom I presume is the doctor, as I answered his questions. He sounded completely disinterested and arrogant. I had to answer and repeat myself SEVERAL times while talking on the phone with him. When I got to the appointment, the desk lady answered and brought my beloved pet into the clinic. She seemed nice and commented how she has pets similar to mine. After that, it all went downhill.  They didn't seem very busy, but it was about an hour before they even saw my dog and called me to ask some more questions about his condition and medication we had given him from a previous vet. Not once during the time my dog was inside did the doctor speak to me at all, although I could hear him talking to the his tech to ask me questions on the phone. I, again, had to repeat myself several times during this interaction. He at one point exclaimed, "They gave him steroids to the ear?!" even though I had just clearly stated 'oral steroids'. After that the tech said they will give me a call back in a few minutes. A half hour went by before I HAD TO CALL THEM to check on my pet, all the while the doctor was sending me several documents to sign about his care and the medicine he was prescribing. I refused to sign those since I hadn't even spoken with the vet let alone talked through different options. My boyfriend and I don't make a lot of money so we always like to have options before proceeding. Never once was I offered one.  The thing that HORRIFIED me the most was that they let my dog run around the office unsupervised while there were at least 2 or 3 other dogs inside that I know of. I can't speak to other dogs temperaments, but mine gets defensive around other dogs when he has a leash on. As soon as I heard that, I declined all treatment, paid for the exam and then left. When I went up to the door to take my pet home, there was a little girl there, which I assume is like a daughter or granddaughter of one of the employees. I find it completely unacceptable that not only this vet clinic is letting pets run around freely, but that they are putting that poor girl in possible harm at the same time.”
- “July 1 at 8 a. m. on a voucher from Best Friends, I took a neighborhood stray to be spayed at this facility.    When I called at 4 PM Dr. Keesal said I could pick her up at five.   However when I picked her up at 5 PM she wasn't moving: she couldn't even lift her head. I was very upset, Dr. Keesal said she would be fine, just to keep her very quiet.     At 10 PM she still was not moving or lifting her head. I began syringe feeding water and gave her 100 mL lactose ringer fluid. which I do with my senior cats.     Following day when I took her to another animal hospital they told me that she was critically anemic, obviously from hemorrhaging after the surgery.     Camino Seco should never have sent her home in that condition.”
- “I did not have an unpleasant experience with the staff unlike the other complainant. I actually find the staff there pretty likeable, which is why it pains me to have to give them such a crumby review. The truth is however Dr. Kiesel just, bottom line not a good vet. He is the only vet that takes my United Pet Care that is somewhat local, so I have gone to him more than once, but will not be back after the last visit.      The first visit was with my cat who he correctly diagnosed with Hyperthyroidism. His suggestion were either do things to "manage" the condition, or that he perform a surgery that has an fairly low success rate. I thought I was going to lose my beloved cat. I did some research and found out about radiation therapy, which was never even mentioned as an option to me. When I talked to Dr. Kiesel about this he poo poo ed me and said, I would do just as well with the surgery. Long story short, took cat to actual animal hospital, scans showed that the tissue causing the issue was throughout his chest and surgery would not have saved the cat's life. Cat got RI and is healthy  again.           Last month I took the dog in for a nail trim, and they did a less than stellar job. So a couple of weeks ago my male bulldog developed a lump between his eyes. I took him in to Dr. Kiesel again. It took the Dr. almost 1/2 hour to get into the room to see the dog, when he did, he more or less poked the dog twice between the eyes. Said "how old is SHE" and then told me more or less that my dog had a tumor, it needed to be operated on an it could be cancerous. After having commented on bulldogs shorter than average life expectancy. I asked isn't there some sort of test you can do before you cut into him? (I was angling for him to do a needle biopsy) Which he said was risky and he wouldn't do. (But hey isn't surgery risky too? wtwhat.) Anyway since the cat experience I went to get another opinion. The result. He has a sebaceous cyst. (Which is kind of like a Pimple out of control). She did a needle biopsy to confirm, then lanced it, gave us antibiotics and the dog is fine.  I mean what the what. Seriously debating making a complaint to the licensing board.”

- “I was AMAZED (and deeply comforted) by the over-the-top customer service--and true kindness--that I experienced before, during, and after my recent MOHS surgery at the River Park location. I received excellent care from every person I interacted with, whether on the telephone, in the office, or in the billing back office! And, since, I went in with a very complex/logistically-challenging insurance situation (and, frankly, some emotional duress about the insurance situation plus nervousness over the surgery itself), I ended up working with several different admin people and nurses to figure out my situation. They went so far as to actually go apply to GET my doctor of choice (Dr. Dihr) covered by my insurance before my first insurance ended (so kind, wow)!! Then, when my new insurance demanded excessive documentation in order to start my policy on time, not only did a few different different staff members work to get my records turned around in record time (I was so grateful!), but then even Dr. Chen himself agreed to come in and give an observation/assessment of my healing (for no extra charge) even though he wasn't the surgeon I saw, so that I could start my new insurance on time. I wish I could thank by name each person who greeted me, dealt with my 2 insurance companies's difficult paperwork requests, helped me see the doctor of my choice, were with me before and during the surgery (so kind, professional, and reassuring!), and who worked with me over the phone. Alas, the only name I have is Bernadette (Bernie), the awesome surgery assistant to Dr. Dihr--thank you Bernie! Furthermore, I am very grateful for the excellent and skillful (and kind) work and words of Dr. Dihr during the surgery itself. I cannot say enough about how relieved and pleased I am with the care I received at HealthySkin. NOTE: I've been dealing with skin issues (including skin cancer) for 10 years, and over the last decade, I've been seen by 4 other dermatologists in Tucson--(3 of whom I could also give a good to great recommendation for (everyone EXCEPT "zero stars" for Specialists in Dermatology, please never go there)--but none as shining as the awesome folks at HealthySkin, and that's in large part because of all their amazing nurses and admin staff!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you. :-)”
- “Such a wonderful place, I am so happy that I found them. I've come in for several different things: first was the removal of a skin tag on my head that was really starting to annoy me. Procedure went smoothly and I only had to wait two weeks for an appointment.   I came back a few months later when I noticed a new weird skin tag on my neck/shoulder area. I waited 3 days for an appointment and went in to see Kathleen, who removed the skin for me and sent it for a biopsy. Well, it came back cancerous, and I was then sent to see Dr. Chen. I did have to wait about 3 weeks for the surgery, but that included having to have a consultation the first week, then 2 weeks wait time to make sure I was not taking medicines that would alter their margin testing. But, once I got in, the procedure went well. Dr. Chen was very professional and it only took two times before the margins were clean. He stitched me up, and I came back in another week to have the top layer of stitches removed. For a 26 year old, I was just happy to have this taken care of quickly and professionally.   Absolutely love this place, their staff, and everyone that I have worked with. I have never had trouble getting an appointment here. In fact, just this Monday I called in to get another appointment for a new weird skin issue (hopefully nothing cancerous!) and I was given an appointment for Tuesday! Yes, the very next day. Maybe it depends on what you need to be seen for--but again, I've never had trouble getting an appointment or speaking to someone on the phone. I highly recommend this place.”
- “I've been going Kathleen McDevitt and she is great! She's always been on time and is very knowledgeable. She always takes the time to explain everything and always listens and throughly answers all of my questions. I highly recommend her!”

- “Two weeks, 4 voicemails, 3 different locations: zero calls back and I never had the chance to speak to a living person. Apparently healthy skin dermatology does not want any new customers! A complaint was lodged with their assistant administrator detailing why I will be taking my business elsewhere (also a voicemail). Don't waste your time if you are a new patient they will not return your calls.”
- “I cannot in good conscience recommend this practice to anyone. Not only did they botch a medical procedure on a child, they did not treat it appropriately in the aftermath, resulting in further injury, pain, and discomfort. To add insult to injury, they subsequently then billed us for all the follow up visits we required to monitor the result of the procedure they messed up in the first place.  My 6 year old son went in for a wart removal on his elbow. One of the physician's assistants applied cantharone plus to the elbow area and then wrapped the elbow. This resulted in a large blister that extended many inches beyond the area where the wart was located. The following morning I called the office because I was concerned that the arm looked badly burned and was spreading. We were brought in and saw a different physican's assistant who did nothing other than give us samples of an intense moisturizer.  Our son was in horrible pain and the mobility in his arm was greatly affected. The following morning it looked even worse with the burn extending up and down his arm and also beginning to wrap around toward the front of the elbow bend. At this point we saw a doctor who FINALLY acknowledged this procedure did not go as planned. He prescribed a topical spray and took a culture because I was concerned it was infected. The spray prescribed is apparently not a common medication because no one could track it down in Tucson and it would take at least a week to order and come in due to the impending weekend. We left two messages at the office inquiring about an alternative method of treatment due to this delay and neither call was returned.   The following day (now 4 days after the procedure) it again looked even worse so we finally took our son to get a second opinion. This doctor took one look at his arm, diagnosed him with 2nd degree chemical burns, debrided the burned area (which was a horribly traumatic and incredibly painful experience for our son) and began treatment with Silvadene.   The results of the culture came back positive for a staph infection which resulted in a 14 day course of antibiotics that made him horribly ill.  Had Sheftel Associates acknowledged from the beginning that this was a burn and subsequently treated it as such it is likely that the burn would have never gotten as bad as it was.  We have made calls to the office to have the bills waived and were essentially told that if we were suggesting they messed up the conversation was over and it would go to their legal counsel. Great customer service!   Please, please, please do not entrust your medical care to this facility.”
- “Would your response BS that:  "Our policy is to welcome and encourage patients who have any concerns or questions about the treatment they received to contact us directly at (520) 293-5757 so that we may continue to provide individualized and excellent care in our community"   be similar to the BS email from your office to me saying:   "We are saddened to hear that you are unhappy with the results of your Levulan treatment. We would like to bring you back in to see *********, PA-C to have her evaluate the areas post procedure to see if she thinks that they look better, and if not, to discuss other treatment options"?    Since you would "like to bring me back in...." I made multiple appointments to finally make the 45 minute one way trip to your office only to find that what you really wanted was more money from:      1. A new referral      2. New insurance      3. Me becoming a NEW patient before you would evaluate the $1000+ work you'd previously done ineffectively with the obvious aim of suggesting, and billing for, "other treatment options".  In either case...I DID contact you....I DID accept the invitation to come back in for you to look at "the areas post procedure" however I didn't foresee that your goal was not to make things right but to make more money and that you wouldn't see me unless that one goal was met.  I understand that many people have left reviews around the internet who love what you did for them.  I've posted MY experience around the internet so that people could also know what you do when what you do doesn't work.    If I buy a car I want to know the warranty if something doesn't work.    If I'm going to pay $1000+ for a skin issue and it isn't solved I'd want to know what kind of "warranty" to expect.”

## Tips from customers
I love Kathleen! She is personable, thorough and fast. And, she is always on time. Darek is very good. Smart So glad I decided to go in for a skin cancer check. They found one on my face. Very friendly staff and customer service focused It's a very well run office and I have always gotten great care. Always fast and friendly service. I usually see Kathleen Mcdivot. She's great! Dr Daniel and staff provide prompt and professional service with a personal touch. Clean office, friendly staff & excellent Drs

- “Water Tec worked hard with me to try and fill my needs. My request to install a water softener and filters in the configuration I needed were not very common, so I got a time and materials with a not-to-exceed estimate. I had bought the filters and softeners on line from another source. The plumbers came and worked as expeditiously as they could, George was the actual plumber that installed my units, very friendly and professional guy.  They also responded very quickly to a very, very small drip that developed and within a day they had sent another plumber to take care of it. I got several calls from Water Tec and it seemed that they had put in motion everyone in their shop to cure the problem.  Did not get my invoice for a while, I was told they only send invoice once a month, which baffled me a bit, buy hey, it's their money and system. I also requested an itemized bill (since it was time and materials) and that took a while to get. But once I left a message to Leigh, it was promptly taken care of.  Anyway, the billing situation will soon be forgotten, but the good workmanship and the understating of my unusual situation will remain for a long time.  Will recommend this company to anyone that asks.”
- “Water Tec, is by far the Cheapest Softening company in Tucson. And their customer support is outstanding.  Never have had any problems, with getting questions answered.  They are very patient and willing to educate you on how to operated, service, and maintain my equipment.  Jake and Greg up at 1st ave are very nice, and very customer friendly.”
- “We contacted Water Tec for a quote on a softener and RO system. Jack arrived on time for the appointment and was wearing a mask when he entered our home. He was extremely knowledgeable about every aspect of water treatment. We purchased a system from him during his visit. Installation of the system was scheduled on the spot for approximately a week later. The technician arrived on time and installed the system for us and thoroughly explained the operation. Its been about one month since installation and everything is working great. The RO water tastes great and were using less laundry detergent. No hard water spots on anything is also wonderful. Give them a call for an estimate, you wont be sorry.”

- “So when you go to someone's house to hand them a 22K dollar estimate for water treatment, for water that is hard but not dangerous, please send a supermodel. That way it will go over better with your potential clients. Really? Like this is Beverly Hills? It is Tucson. The salesman didn't even have a lower cost option. Nice how they try to rip people off. Like I said, at least coming from a Chippendale it would have gone over better or someone that knew the products. There was nothing dangerous in the water...no heavy metals, bacteria, nothing...they want to rip people off!!! Watch out!!! The salesman had to keep calling someone for information on the water system, he didn't even have knowledge about the equipment. He also has no public health knowledge. I have both a medical and public health degree, and these people try to fabricate problems with water that is hard. There was no arsenic or selenium in the water, by the way. Scary. I guess 20 years experience on their end means they have been doing it wrong for that long. Amazing.”
- “02162021 Water-Tec 3333 N 1st Ave Tucson, AZ 85705 Phone number (520) 352-3333 Business website watertectucson.com I have been to Yelp before regarding Water-Tec. It will be my last. I just removed their Evolution Water System installed on July 21, 2017. Please understand my purpose in writing today is to warn those who have recently purchased from Water-Tec and have an outside installation that the materials used will leak if exposed to the sun in less than four years. I am especially concerned when reading on Next Door the poor service delivered to a 91-year old woman by Water-Tec. I am an engineer and have the experience to do the type of repairs and research that was needed to repair the leaks. Within 18 months the cartridge filter system leaked. I was able to duplicate the cartridge filter at Home Depot. Since then I have replaced one of the connections on the media filter canister. Last week I noticed the top fitting on the media filter was leaking.  Through my research I have it on good authority that these parts used by Water-Tec are not made for outdoor installations that are directly in the line of the sun. I recommend that if you have a Water-Tec system and it is installed outside the home exposed to the sun that your cover it with something that keeps the sun off their fittings.  8/9/2017  In response to a Yelp posting dated 8-8-17 by Leigh D. the owner of Water-Tec I am told.  It is true that I told Rick that I would give Water-Tec a less than five star rating if I did not get what I was promised.  I was promised by a Water-Tec employee 20% discount.  A 20 % discount would have been over $400 versus the $250 I settled for.  The pen is mightier than the sword comment was made when I agreed to avoid arguing with Rick.  Leigh goes on to say, "I am puzzled by several comments made by the home owner that I think were added for affect. "After a number of failed attempts....." beginning Monday 7-24-17 Water Tec tried unsuccessfully to schedule a follow up visit for that week but was unable to schedule with the home owner."  Here Leigh demonstrates that Water-Tec will perform only at their convenience versus the buyer.  Leigh goes on to say, " Secondly, at no time was there ever any mention of discoloration of water to anyone on our staff. The home owner is correct that this does typically disappear within a day or two as in this case."  Why was this not disclosed by a Water-Tec employee?" Further Leigh writes, "On 7-13-17 the home owner accepted our proposal to install a new system with an install date of 7-21-17 in the morning. Due to a record month of rainfall during our monsoon season we had a couple of jobs that were delayed. The morning before the scheduled install, Marco spoke to the home owner to ask if we could move the install to later in the day. Although many companies give an AM (morning)or PM (afternoon) our customers are given a 2 hour time window for arrival. Marco gave an arrival time window for the following day of 11am-1pm. which the home owner accepted. During the conversation the home owner did ask for a discount at which time Marco documented the request."  What Leigh fails to write is Marco promised me 10% discount for such a huge favor.  Marco also said that the instal would be promptly at 11 AM without a two hour window. Using Leigh's words he goes on to say, "The following day the home owner called between the 11am to 1pm time window asking when the installer would be arriving. The installer was completing his previous install and would call when finished. Again, the home owner asked for an additional discount. At approximately 1pm the installer spoke to the home owner that he was in route and he did indeed arrive at 1:30 pm. The installer was 30 minutes out of his time window but there was a conversation with the customer during this time as is company policy for a late arrival. During the installation it was discovered that excess concrete had been poured (covered by dirt) which resulted in additional labor to remove. Once the concrete was removed there was a shortage of dirt to correctly complete the job that afternoon. The installer returned the following morning (Saturday) with the necessary dirt and completed the job. Although this was an unforeseen additional expense Water Tec never asked to alter the original quote."  It should be noted that there was never a two hour window given even as Leigh states is his company policy.  I would have been happy to live with a two hour window were it offered.  Most importantly is we paid an up charge for the jack hammering as written by Rick in the proposal.  Rick and I even discussed this at the site of installation as I had just had Valentine Plumbing install a gas line where they also had to use a jack hammer to bury the pipe. He then goes on to say, "In closing at no point did the owners of Water Tec refuse to speak to the home owner. The home owner did ask for several discounts and after having a discussion with the employees i”
- “This past Monday I had a confirmed appointment and what a HORRIBLE experience. My appointment was between 3 and 5 PM. I raced home from work and waited and waited and waited..... Finally at 4:30 I called Water Tec and spoke to Chris. He couldn't tell me what happened and the person who was supposed to come had gone home. Most disappointing was there was no concern or offer to do something to make up for their mistake. I told him so and he said he couldn't do anything. He said, do you want to reschedule?? Really??? I asked for a manager and the manager wasn't available. I asked that a manager call me as soon as possible. Chris said okay. Well today I'm writing my review because a manager has not called and it is 4 days later.  We really try to do business with local companies but when you get treated so poorly it makes you feel like maybe in water treatment systems, a national company is the way to go.”

## Tips from customers
Make sure to ask of any additional charges if they are servicing your equipment ie Trip Charges. Was charged a
$22.50 Trip Charge that was not part of original quote to change RO Filters.
Total came to $140.00 before a 5% discount which the serviceman forgot to give us. Made a comment that we would plan on changing filters ourselves next year and was told by owner it would void our warranty!!?? Excellent !!

- “This is the third visit to the store this Summer.   I come in the store (well groomed looking normal), and I get stared down by at least 4 employees as I walk in.   I had a coupon for $5.00 Ace Rewards.  I wanted to shop around but felt so uncomfortable with all of the staring, and fake "can I help you", "do you need help", my chest was hurting.   I picked up a flag, paid.  I had to ask for a bag.....and then I left.   There is to much pressure to hurry up, shop, and GET OUT.....It seems the employees will get a bonus if they catch someone stealing.  I am a public school history teacher.   I DO NOT STEAL.  I am also Jewish, and "thou shalt no steal", especially on a Saturday.....I got the one item, and got out of there before I get accused of something.   There is not come in store with an item you came in to get ((the flag)), and shop around....it is get what is on your list pay,  and get OUT!!!”

I used to drive a BMW and hated going in for service so much that I wouldn't consider buying another one!”
- “I never really push reviews but this definitely deserves one let me start off by saying the moment I walked in I was greeted with nothing but compassion and understanding due to my situation my car had just broken down they came and picked me up at my location. When I got there I was introduced to Rick and everybody in the office they reassured me they would do everything they could to help me get approved.. . I picked out the car I wanted and they went to work finding the perfect lender.. I wasn't an easy approval I went through a repossession and had lower credit due to starting over but was making my way back up I had went to a few different dealerships and got the denial speech .. idk how but they made it happen.. they worked with me on my down payment.. they handled everything above what was needed.. I got everything I asked for an MORE. I went in a few days later to bring some things in an again was greeted with the most respect an care!! If you are looking for a car used or new I strongly recommend this place!! Amazing an I wish I could give them a 10star rating!!! I've bout new cars before from Larry H an a few others an never have I ever had this experience.. not to mention the time it took.. I expected to be there for hours an hours An it was fast an easy ... GOTO VOLVO AN GET YOUR CAR OR TRUCK!!!  Thank you so much Rick for your help and understanding!!! Mike for going out of your way to pickin me up An helping me find what I needed!!”
- “my son wanted to buy his first used Pickup Truck... He found  the one he wanted at Volvo of Tucson.  They had the Dodge he wanted on their used car lot. From the very first contact to the last, all of the staff was outstanding!  The price and the warranty were both very fair and even the train-in price was fair. This was my son's first dealership/ used car lot experience and it went great!  They are honest people, not just because of the deal my son got or because of how they treated him overall, but because months after the deal was done, they sent my son a check for $151.00 - it was for overpayment on the licensing for the 2015 truck he purchased.  Never have I had a dealer do such a thing. We will always send people to  Volvo of Tucson and we plan to look you up for our next car purchase. Sales team was great and the finance department was outstanding as well.  Thank you for helping my son have a good experience at your dealership!  Gerard Raneri”

- “If you want to spend 8+ hours dealing with lazy, uncaring sales people who will tell you lies and swindle you every single step of the way, this is the place you want to go. I was fast-talked into a lease 2 years ago by a sales man who cared more about getting photos of me, without knowing or being educated on what a lease really is. The vehicle I chose had several issues with its electronics and sensors that nobody could explain, nor did they take the time to investigate. I was advised to keep my vehicle spotless and those issues would go away. After one year the thing already needed new tires and brakes, which needed to be paid for by me. "High performance, luxury vehicles have higher maintenance requirements than your every day car", I was told. I finally traded this POS in, but the "fun" didn't end there. I am now being reported as 90+ days past due on my credit report because these people may have my old car but they have neglected to inform the finance company of that fact. Resolution? "Just make two car payments a month until they tell you to stop. They'll refund your money".   And to round it all off, the new loan I signed (after 2 hours of waiting for who knows what) is now in my husband's name, which I was not informed of either. He was supposed to be the co-signer, but hey, details right?  In summary, I've experienced heart-break, excuses, lies, incompetence, waste of my time, and what I consider harassment at this point at that dealership. If you value your sanity and belief in the goodness of people, stay as far away from this place as possible.”
- “Absolute rip off artists  Go here if you'd like to get les than half what your trade in is worth. Probably the worst dealership to visit in Tucson.   These people are worthless thieves you'd be better off donating your car than dealing with these guys”
- “The parts department is useless. I explained to them the part my mechanic told me I needed to fix my air conditioning. They decided I actually needed a bigger part costing $150.00. OK, fine whatever, I didn't need it then as my mechanic had jury rigged the a/c to work. A few months later, as he warned me it would, it failed. So I went in and ordered the "part" I needed. 3 days later, they call and say, "Oh no, that part isn't available anymore". So I drop by. The guy behind the counter says  "Yeah, haven't been able to get that for at least 7 years." Thanks for "quoting me a price" and "taking my order" for a non-existent part. Turns out, what I really needed, the valve in the pipe, is readily available online. It cost 8 bucks. These clowns have no idea what they're doing.”

- “This place is amazing!  Definitely satisfied and definitely recommend! Very low key spot, I never have to wait long.  Service is quick and the ladies are very gentle when threading! This is by Far the Best experience I've had with threading!   My eyebrows are always hideous and uneven, but by the time I leave this place, these ladies always let me leave with an even pair of brows :)   Only negative that I have is that the prices are just a tad higher than what I'm used to but suites their service.”
- “Clean shop, open Sundays and reasonable prices !!! RECOMMENDED no appointments needed ,”
- “Consistently great experiences every time our family has been to this salon. The staff and owner are friendly and personable, service is quick, and the prices are quite reasonable, compared to similar businesses in town. We've even had family and friends from out of town get their eyebrows done here, with rave reviews. Highly recommended...  (and as a bonus, it's in the Williams Center, so you're right next to burgers and solid gelato after threading is finished)”

- “I went in with full eyebrows that needed to be clean up. I sat up from the chair & realized my left eyebrow was much thinner and jagged. I mentioned to the woman terrible job & she said "Oh I thought it was like that." Me not wanting cause a scene, walked to the register to pay for this terrible job....and she proceeds to charge me full price. Quietly, I say, "even though you completely wrecked my eyebrow?" Then she took $1 off. Needless to say, I will not be returning to this location. Terrible way to treat a client of many years.”
- “Opened late. Didn't acknowledge or greet me...the first was salutation was "sit in the chair". When I responded with good morning the clerk roller her eyes. There was also a language barrier in explaining what service and how I wanted my eyebrows shaped.”
- “I've gotten theaded in California before but never in Tucson. I decided to try this place out because it's fairly close to my house. The staff is fairly nice and the place is well kept. I got my full face done with the exception of my eyebrows which I already have someone doing. The experience overall was okay but when I left, I noticed I was bleeding. I had two open wounds by my eye which I wasn't even told about. I also ended up with some red bruising by my kneck. At the very least I should have at least been told about it. Obviously, I would never go back nor would I recommend it to anyone else. Threading is fantastic, but not at this place.”

## Tips from customers
Fast and friendly. Rewards system is a bonus! $30 for full-face threading...expensive!! This is my go to eyebrow place! They always do a great job. Go here all the time. Love it. This is a great alternative to waxing but I think it is more painful. They do a good job however. I'm always satisfied with the work they do. Very clean job Best eyebrow threading in town! Friendly staff is a plus. Very clean job Clean shop, open Sundays and reasonable prices !!! RECOMMENDED They do my eyebrows well. I recommend great prices and also offer a rewards program I always love the results I asked for a clean up and now my eyebrows are twice as thin as they were before. Good and quick customer service. Nice clean facility. Not a long wait at all.

- “First off walking in the front door is like heaven for a bowhunter or an archer for that matter.  I picked up a brand new 2012 Brute X in skullworks camo and man this bow is sweet the set it up sized and draw weight for free with new resized d-loop. i brought my own sight and drop away and they even installed those.. PSE is just plain top notch service and top notch products. I have been back twice since and you get a free month use of their indoor range when you buy a bow.   Thank you PSE pro shop team I'll be back for sure”
- “PSA archery in Tucson is an industry leader. Consistently rated above other firms in the business PSA is a Tucson gem, with great service and superior products. The earlier low rating from a "Madison" seemed out of place so I looked up her other ratings. Almost all  of them are zeros, suggesting she might be one as well.”
- “After talking about it for 20 years I recently decided to get into archery like most of my friends. I wanted to stay local and support a hometown business that makes products in the USA. I'm very glad I decided to go with PSE. I purchased a 2013 Brute-X in skullworks camo. They are currently 25% off. Their carbon fiber arrows and some releases are 25% off as well. So my whole package came at a 25% discount - not a bad way to start out! The best part of the whole experience was working with the two techs in the pro shop,  Chad and Will. They were very helpful and patient with a newbie full of questions.  They got me set up with my proper draw length and arrows, and Chad gave me a quick tutorial on the basics of shooting form, and I was off and running. When you buy a bow, you get a month of free range time (indoors and out). They do now offer a range membership, $35 a month or $200 a year for unlimited access.  Or you can pay $7 a day or $5 for military.  PSE does offer a military discount, I believe it's 10%, might be more.  I have heard some bad things in the past about the PSE proshop, but those things seem to be just that, in the past. The problematic,  rude techs are long gone and things are looking up! I highly recommend this place for all archers, whether new to the sport like me, or seasoned vets.”

- “Certainly not the friendliest pro shop I've dealt with.  They make you feel like an inconvenience.  However, I knew what I wanted, they had it, I bought it.  Anything else I need for my archery needs I'll purchase on line, at least then I won't get frost bite.”
- “Bought a bow online, the limbs split and splinter every year during non use, for no reason, pse warrantied the parts the previous years, this year, they ask for a receipt or they won't warranty.... pse registered the bow, but won't warranty because I don't have a receipt from 6 years ago. Customer service just tells you to bad. Buy a product from a company that will warranty their product as they state they will.”
- “DO NOT BUY THE 2016 PSE DRIVE R!!!  I can't even believe these people want to call themselves one of the top archery brands! I'm disgusted and appalled.  No longer do I want to buy PSE products. I'd rather take our future business to a better more respectful company.Their FAULTY Product could have severely injured/ killed my husband who is an experienced archer and hunter, and that makes me infuriated. I hope they put out a recall but they most likely won't so I'm trying to save some lives. Customer service was alerted to the issue, and I basically got the big fat middle finger, and them trying to blame my husbands " improper " use. A top rated company should have good customer service not an instant screw you attitude.   Here's how it all happened: My husband received this bow in the skull-works II color for Christmas. We went down and bought it at our local PSE archery dealer, after hours of research, as he had shot a compound bow before, and wanted a better one for larger game hunting. PSE SHOULD HAVE inspected their Product BEFORE it ever left their factory but they did NOT. This specific bow did not even just have one problem, it had MULTIPLE! A $500 product made by a top rated company should have 0 Problems NOT multiple. With all the issues of faulty craftsmanship, it broke 24 of the arrows we bought for it. When you would go to release the arrow, the cable guard knocked off veins and swings the arrows to the left causing him to miss the target all together. Which in turn, damaged the arrows when they scrapped along the ground and hit the wall behind the target. This would not have happened, had the bow not been faulty.     We owned the product for exactly 5 days before the string stop wore almost all the way through the cable, and the cable guard was placed by the factory in the wrong direction. Due to the issues that were caused during manufacturing, if he were to draw it back at its 70lb draw weight again, the cable could have snapped back from the pressure easily damaging my husbands face, and potentially taking out his eye or getting him killed if he had been hunting large game and been spotted by an animal who decided to charge him. It is supposed to be placed to the right, but this one was placed to the left. So we had to take it in to be repaired, and the shop ended up replacing the bow when they had it for an entire week  after they discovered the multiple problems. All of the issues would not have happened if it were manufactured properly instead of carelessly. So please don't buy yourself a headache and injury waiting to happen.”

- “Very happy with our emergency plumbing service! I've had bad experiences with other plumbing companies (unfriendly techs, not solving the problem, crazy up-charges) so I wasn't looking forward to another bad experience. This was the opposite in every way. From the time we placed the call to clean up and paper work, the service was professional, friendly, and thorough.”
- “Let me start off by saying that we went through two additional companies for diagnostics and spoke to local plumbers over the phone. My husband found Penguin Air Jose and Charles went above for us! We're new to the area so this has been a stressful situation. Jose and Charles took their time examining our home. Took time to educate what the issues could be and made sure to reassure us that no matter what it's our health/safety and getting our home in order that is priority. Thank you Jose and Charles for giving myself, my husband and our son all your attention/efforts/hard work! They have our business and recommendations for sure!”
- “My AC froze up during the evening it was so hot; my unit had literally froze up (there was ice); Called Penguin and they identified the probably immediately and were able to fix the probably quickly and professionally.  I was very impressed with their service technician and I decided to sign up for the club membership (maintenance) - so that my AC will be regularly maintained and so I never have to suffer without AC again. They also do plumbing so I'll definitely call them if I experience plumbing issues.”

- “Their 'services' nearly cost me $9,000-13,000-. Glad I got a second opinion. The problem was disconnected wires, not the heating unit.”
- “Up charges like crazy. Our technician had no idea what he was doing and tried to tell us it was an electrical problem which it was not. They wanted over $1,000 and we decided to fix it ourselves and paid under $300. The technician opened up a wall outlet and caused sparks to fly everywhere as well as blew the breaker. He was only certified for HVAC and NOT electrical. He had no business in trying to pull out an outlet. He was not educated in our set up and told us he didn't know how to work on it. I DO NOT recommend this place and if for some reason you decide to go with them ask for any tech but Ryan.”

- “I bought an Interstate battery online about 3 months ago. It is completely dead. I called this store and asked what they can do. Their reply was, bring in the receipt and we will see. I verified that nothing can be done unless I happened to keep the receipt. I know these batteries can be traced with the serial numbers on the back. This store is just not willing to back up their product. After calling customer service 866-842-5368 I was informed that w/o a receipt there is nothing anyone can do for me.  Interstate Battery Wholesale and Interstate themselves are not willing to stand behind their product even tho my ebay purchase tracking shows the date that I purchased the battery.  Will I ever purchase another Interstate battery?  Hell no!”
- “I wanted to give Interstate Battery my business, but they could not seem to stick to their quote or their policies so I had to take my money elsewhere.  I went a few times to test my battery, I knew it was going out, I was told by one employee it was covered under warranty and would cost either nothing or "Next to Nothing" and that I did not need a receipt for the warranty because each battery had a traceable serial number. My boyfriend went back the following day to change out the battery and get the replacement, this time another associate asks for the receipt of the battery for the warranty? AFTER I WAS JUST TOLD I DID NOT NEED A RECEIPT? Wow, mind-boggling and then tries to sell me a brand new $110 battery, that sure does not seem like NEXT TO nothing to me. I think the second sales associate was trying to up-sell me and in turn lost good business. I only patronize honest businesses so I took my  money elsewhere and bought a brand new battery for $85 with a legitimate warranty!”

I know these are real too because there's no signs of them being fake. the first pic is Mexican Fluorite which was extremely reasonably priced for $11.77 and the second pic is rose quartz and hutch was $3.77. The rose quartz back in my hometown of Providence, Rhode Island was the same size as this and was $7.00. all of these crystals are reasonably priced and if i lived in Tucson i would definitely come back again. five stars all the way! the rest of the stones i got are in the 3rd pic”

Familiar food. Fast. Easy. Love the sandwiches (banana peppers!), but the employees at this one seem a bit...off. No banana peppers!! Interesting crew they have working. Not necessarily in a negative way. Just different. Understaffed at times. Add special things (double meat, double cheese, avocado), get a free cookie! Out of Tea. WTF

Also, they have a horrible selection of drinks for a cafe. For an iced tea (with no refills) its $2.50. What a joke.  But this place has great potential, they just need to turn down the music and offer free refills on drinks and they would have my business daily.”

Great seasonal brew selection! Solar powered goodness The house-made gingerale and lemonade are really tasty. We had a blast yesterday on the patio with our dogs. Skybars happy hour runs till 8pm!! Thats $1 off drafts and $2 wells until 8pm!!! Study sesh Free cucumber water. It's good! Monday night trivia! You can order pizza from Brooklyn next door and enjoy it at Sky Bar.  And their homemade ginger mixer is really great. The don't have skim milk :( New furniture. Drink prices have gotten another bump (coffee is now $2). Always have a blast Wednesday night open mic, can bet pretty interesting (and weird) Deanna and Bronson are really nice. I love the telescope on the weekends. Ginger ale made fresh daily! Now 100% solar powered. Coffee, tea, beer or cocktail--all go fine with a slice of Brooklyn from next door. Great ambiance !!! Refreshing beverages !!! Never a dull moment ; ) Not 4th on fourth anymore!!! Love it. It's like the new Plush, only hipper! Try their L.A. Water. Pretty good drink prices. Giving it another shot, maybe was being too adamant? And tonight's the adult spelling bee. I like beer. And they have beer. Good vibe.  Here to watch some friends tango! Saturday hh til 7. $3 beers...just do it. Coffee or beer to help study? Service even on a slow day (Wed. 3pm) is poor.  Waiting 10 minutes for an ice coffee while bartender chats with friends and texts. Also: flies. Lots of them. WiFi speedtest: 12/8. March 4th playing AND telescopes for the lunar eclipse?! Winners Hot Era dance party Four words: Delirium Tremens on tap! Only place in Tucson that knows how to make a proper old fashioned and Moscow mule. Get Shwifty Stop afternoon mid-week. Not a great environment. Caught on film performing..,.the only time I come here Here to see Blind Divine :) Pizza, beer and Yankees on the TV! Oops! This is where I need to thank Jamie and Cristina! Session-the new $2 beer Hipster town, AZ The perfect spot for another going away soiree! The Royal Flush with Crown is fruity and nice. One of the best house specials is the Ginger Vodka; they muddle their own ginger syrup, and you are in for a serious treat. Great place for entertainment,food etc! The body odor smell as you walk in is just the bouncer. Everywhere else in the bar smells better, trust me. Spelling bee... Watch the game, here! $1 iced coffee cant beat that! Solar power and dog friendly. Get your pizza delivered from Brooklyn Pizza next door. Trivia night! There is now a $1 charge for closing a bar tab (no matter how much the cost and even if you leave the tab open at any time), every one even the first one. Get ready to pay an additional $1 with every order. Used to be a crappy dive bar and now it's this rocking place! The tap water is great! Solar Guild Party Sucks if you want drinks Order from Brooklyn Pizza and have it delivered to Sky Bar. Bring your dog too. Great solar-powered bar and pizzeria with telescopes set up on patio.  Lively, geeky crowd, mostly younger folks.  Nice atmosphere. Wednesday is open mic night. A dog friendly bar. Wtf? Bar on Friday night? Who am i? Go look through the telescopes on their patio! We saw the moon and Saturn, it was really cool :) I do love blue moon beer. much busier at night than during the day but not too packed to get a spot to park, at least on monday. i like this place although the crowd is a bit strange seeming. Clean potties. Awesome place you can relax and be yourself there. Good tunage as well More... Maui Brewing Company Big Swell here!!!! Looking at the stars

- “Great venue! We have our ballet productions here and they are very accommodation. The building is absolutely stunning! The ballroom is beautiful. The sets our amazing as well. Lynn is fun to work with. Would make a great wedding venue or charity event venue!”
- “Great venue! We had our wedding reception in the red room and it was an excellent room with great location and a great atmosphere. All of our guests were very impressed by the beauty and historical aspect of the building and the building is well maintained considering its age. Lynn was extremely helpful as venue manager and she went above and beyond to make sure that everything ran smoothly. We were very happy with our choice and would recommend to anyone interested.”
- “We just held our sons Eagle Scout ceremony in the Grand Parlour. This building is absolutely stunning, and full of history. I couldn't have been more pleased with the help we received. Very smooth. It's really a hidden gem in Tucson and I feel very blessed to have been able to celebrate my sons accomplishments in such a beautiful building.”

- “My niece held her wedding here in this beautiful room - too bad she hadn't read the yelp review from July. The wedding coordinator made promises and it all sounded good but on the actual wedding day they messed up in just about every way you can imagine. It so happened my niece, the bride, was a restaurant manager and by dropping her bride mode and going into management mode and recruiting some of her best friends to work as servers, she managed to save the day for most of the other guests....well everyone around me had a great time but I can't speak for all guests. Among the things screwed up: too few tables, too few chairs, too few servers, too few serving utensils, forgetting to serve some appetizers, forgetting food for children, forgetting wine on tables, on and on. Poor bride almost had to put an apron on over her gown. Nightmare city.”
- “This review gets 1 star because well, I cannot put zero. In all fairness the place is beautiful, clean, and kinda cool with the Mason thing going on. The problem comes with the rental coordinator/manager or whatever her title is. She rents out the halls for events and I recently worked as a vendor at one of these events. I walked into a place filled with their negativity and they proceeded to tell me what to do - mainly how to serve my guests. There was noo assistance and they looked like they didn't want to be there. Then I heard from my clients about how they were treated -  paying clients treated as a nusiance and were not assisted at all. Even worse promised goods were not delivered by the venue and the client was not notified untill the day of the event. No apology was given and they had a bad attitude all night.  Not thinking to much of it untill the end of the event when the client was preparing their food to go with some foil and the venue lady swiped the foil out of her hand and threw it away.  In summation - The attitude and lack of customer service is very inappropiate and un-becoming of people involved in the event industry. It makes me sad that great places are closing while crap like this is going on. Wake up your downtown - the construction makes it even harder to get to you and your place isn't the greatest in the world...develop some damn customer service skills or hire someone so we don't ahve to deal with this bs again.   Telling vendors that you'll allow us to work there if a client books us and then going around spreading lies about us and forcing them to call other vendors...  Adjective run off time: Unprofesssional and bad!  I won't work here again!! and Vendors and clients be wary of the scottish rite!!!”
- “Potential clients beware of this venue mainly due to Peggy Atchley, the event coordinator for the Scottish Rite Cathedral. Unfortunately due to our experience with her on the day of our event, it left an awful feeling for us, some of our guests and vendors. Everything from her negative attitude, where simple questions seemed to be a bother, her demeanor on the day of the event, as if we where now a burden, to even yelling and mistreating some of our guests. I'm not sure of all the details but she even started cursing and creating a scene with two of our vendors regarding setup locations. In my opinion, we asked for simple items to be corrected or assisted with and it was too much of a hassle. It came to a point where we did not want to bother her with anything further but she made it very clear that we need to stop our event at 11:20pm in order to be completely out by midnight. I say good luck to anyone who chooses this venue, especially when you have many other choices downtown. Based on our original consults, everything was planned and promised to be done in a professional manner. That was far from the picture that was painted. I warn you to take a further look into this location, as they are understaffed, which plays a big part into your night running smoothly and which definitely leads to the added stress for Peggy Atchley and her outbursts. Should you choose this location, hire your own event coordinator and additional staff because Peggy will not deliver.”

- “This review is solely on those who shop at Ross.....  We are all there for the same reason, to find a deal. With that being said, it's not a daycare center. Please don't let your children run free around the store to tear it up, bump into other customers and scream at the top of their lungs for no reason at all. Please be respectful of others shopping experience.  And to the store employees.... I know it's not your place or mine to babysit these children, but you could very well lose lots of customers because of this. Not to mention they tear up your store and could get seriously hurt.”

- “I've been shopping at this Ross for years and tonight I had such a horrible experience I am probably never going back. I went into Ross and I was looking around in the clothing section and I went over to the active wear and when I walked away some older lady that was an employee went over to where I was at and was mumbling under her breath curse words in Russian. I didn't mess up the clothes I just simply skimmed through them. So a BIG FUCK YOU to that lady and if I knew your name I would of been glad to call you out if you can't handle your job then you shouldn't be working there.”

Great place for cheap kitchen supplies This is a nicer, cleaner Ross store. Some stores in Tucson are gross Good place to get nice bath towels at cheap prices

She gave us pointers on how to best organize our documents and also clearly explained how the process was going to work on our end. She went through everything line by line in extreme detail and was beyond helpful.

The staff were very helpful and we used their service later that evening. The next morning our paperwork was ready to go. We stopped in, notarized the paperwork, and the Deed is now updated! It couldn't have been any easier. Thank you for all of your help, taking out the guesswork, and getting us on our way! We would certainly recommend them!”

- “I contacted them initially online - response for 2 days.  I only had a simple quit claim to complete and altho I could have paid $35 to file myself, I wanted the safety of talking with a paralegal to ask questions and make sure all was well.  I only got a notarized document adn had to request to ask a question.  Then I was assured I would be notified once it was filed (the next day)   Without any notification after 1 week I called and asked and was assured I would get an email confirming the filing and that it would be completed the next day.  nothing.  I left a message expressing my frustration and unhappiness with their lack of service for which I overpaid $140.  Four more days and no response  They don't care about service - only making money.  Unprofessional.”

- “I have no idea why this place has bad reviews. I guess more people like to complain than compliment, but we moved to Tucson a few months ago and have had nothing but positive experiences with this Pizza Hut. They are great with special requests and are always prompt with welcoming staff. Note: We just order via phone and ask about deals, so I can't comment on the online portion.”
- “I really like Pizza Hut as a whole but this location I think by far makes the best pizza. Every time I order from here the pizza is just bomb. The crust is perfect, melty cheese, just amazing. I don't ever review but I just HAD to leave a review for this one. It didn't even show up on yelped and I added the business! If you reside around this area, definitely choose this location for your next delivery pizza.”
- “Stuff happens. In any business. What the business does when it happens is the true measure.  Our delivery driver delivered our pizzas and pasta within the expected time, but somehow he got on the road without our order of boneless wings. When I asked about them he quickly checked the receipt, then gave what I perceived to be a sincere apology, and said he'd go back to get them and be right back.  He was back in about 10 minutes (the pizzahut location is about 5 minutes away), with a fresh batch of wings; he had called them as he left our house, and they had a fresh batch ready for him when he got there.  Couldn't be happier with the fast and courteous  service!”

- “This place is just out there... There main online platform deals do not go together. When I tried to call them they told me to hold so the sales attended needed to speak to a manager and it took over 15 min to get an answer. This place needs to redo its business model to other pizza huts like the one on campbell. Its called fast food for a reason I am not ordering something fancy. Please look at your deals, and timing those are key.”
- “Disappointed.  Ordered pizza and wings.  Took 1 hour and 10 minutes.  Ok... pizza was was barely warm, wings same thing, not crispy but soggy and again just warm.  Basically I was eating leftovers.  Not at all worth the $43.  Figured as much after an hour (their store is only 5 minutes away).  But after waiting, who wants to send it back and start again.  There are better choices out there.”
- “Tried the Detroit style pizza and was very disappointed. The sauce was too sweet making it unappetizing. Would not recommend it!”

- “This review is for a purchase of a set of four new tires.  I have a great mechanic (see Wood-Oberholzer review), so I haven't utilized Firestone Auto Service, although they automatically did a complimentary check-up with my tire purchases.  I'd purchased my last set of tires from this Firestone 4 years ago and remembered it had been a good experience.  This experience was better even.  Typically, most retail is slowest on Wednesdays, so I arrived when they opened (7:15 am).  Christian assisted me with my options after I spoke to him about our driving needs (5,000 city, not highway, miles/year) and budget ($500).  He made two recommendations, and of course, I chose the least expensive, declining Roadside Service (we have AAA).  He quoted me a completion time of approximately 8:30 and an out the door price of $385 for the tires (215/65R16, if you must know).  Their rest room is clean, and the waiting area is pleasant with decent magazines (current:  ESPN, AZ Highways, etc.).  Fry's Food Store is across the street, and McDonald's is next door.    My name was called at about 8:35, I paid after he advised me the results of our car's exam and was out the door by 8:45.  I'd researched other tire stores and pricing on-line, so I felt good about this experience.  It definitely exceeded my expectations.”
- “Extraordinary customer service! The crew at this Firestone almost save my life!   My car broke down on I-10 in Benson AZ due to overheating on a Saturday. I had to tow my car to Tucson to get it fixed as everything was closed in Benson. I decided to tow it to a Firestone b/c they were the only one that closes late. There are three Firestones in Tucson. After calling all of them, I decided to tow my car to this particular location b/c the lady on the phone was super helpful and promised to have my car checked right away.  My tow truck arrived at 3:30pm and they were able to do the diagnostic shortly after. It turned out the radiator cracked. It was deff not cheap to replace it but I didn't have any other choice as I was on the road moving from Florida to California. Ashley was very kind to offer me a student discount for my diagnostic then another $100 off for repair.   Two mechanics worked on my car diligently for two full hours. When they were closing at 6pm, I was really worried that they would not be able to fix it the same day. After learning about my situation, Ashley informed me that the crew would stay late to finish the job so I could get back on the road and head to Phoenix where I made a hotel reservation previously. So they closed the shop and continued to work on my car. While I was waiting, Ashley even offered me a cold soda! Talk about top notch customer service!!   Finally the young men finished the job at 7pm then took my car for a test drive to ensure it would run well. When it was time to pay, Ashley tried to help me save and recommended applying a Firestone credit card so I could get another 10% off which I did.   The crew at this Firestone went above and beyond to take care of me. I couldn't even believe it when I was back on the road 3 hours after my car was towed here. And I made it to Phoenix the same day as scheduled! Thank you Ashley and Firestone crew!! You guys are the BEST!!”
- “Today I had to get my car towed to Firestone due to a hose bursting, and they were incredibly helpful. A man named Christian helped us and he was knowledgable, and seemed to want to do what was best both for my car and most efficient cost wise! I thought I would be there for hours and pay tons of money but I was there for an hour tops, and paid under $100 dollars. They also have a student discount which is nice.”

- “I had a flat tire and was waiting for a tow truck so I called Firestone to check wait times. They said it was a two hour wait until they could see my car, and they made an appointment for me. The tow truck took and hour and a half to get to me, and I thought timing would be perfect. I called again to verify, and they said I lost my place in line and it would be a two hour wait before they got to my car. Horrible service.”
- “These people destroyed the motor on my GMC Yukon ! They caused $6500.00 worth of damage on an unauthorized test drive. If the technician was involved in a collision . They would be liable for damages. If my truck was in their shop and the shop caught fire. They would be liable for damages. The same doctrine should apply in my case. At every level. (The shop, regional corporate headquarters and their insurance company. I have encountered nothing but bullying, rudeness , denial incompetence and downright LIES ! They refuse to pay for the damage caused by their employee on the unauthorized test drive. Do not let them touch your vehicle! I have reported them to the BBB and the Arizona Attorney General.”
- “I went ahead and brought in one of my wheels that was leaking from the bead. The guy at the front desk just grabbed the air compressor and put air in the tire and said it was bent because of it. I knew that this wasn't right and thought it wasn't worth the confrontation. They did not put any effort in to even take a look at it. It's pretty hard to tell of a bent wheel without even giving a proper view. I went ahead and took it into a different shop and they inspected it saying that the tire and wheel was fine as they were able to just re sat the tire on the bead. This is my first experience with this Firestone location, but I will definitely not go back. If you do plan on going in go ahead and double check their information.”

## Tips from customers
Always friendly, helpful and responsive.  Nice people to work with. Great tires!! The technicians here are extremely helpful Lifetime alignment 169.99! They give a student discount! So pull out those student IDs! Look at the clean and busy shop... Talk with Shelly (store manager) you will love this place. Get a discount carwash at Metro Carwash with service at firestone.

- “I've lived in Tucson my whole life. When the Wildcat house closed I was at a loss. I felt Tucson had lost a Rich piece of night-life history. But when I saw the building reopened as a bbq place, I felt optimistic about the future of our city. I've gone there a few times over the years and love the food. Tonight they raised the bar. The atmosphere is stimulating without being loud or overwhelming. Large wooden beams stacked bordering the dining area made me reminiscent of my child hood Lincoln logs. Call me nostalgic but that's how I felt. Like a kid in a candy store! The food was amazing and the service impeccable. Since Covid I've felt customer service has been lacking, whether it be at the grocery store or with my cable provider. Not at Brother John's. Our server Ben, (we found out it was his first day) was very professional and forthcoming with answers to every question on the menu. My wife can be very thorough. And the front of house manager Jamie, a charming and friendly business woman. She was clearly in her element in what could have otherwise been a chaotic atmosphere. Stopping to check on us, we felt like guests of honor. I'm not usually one to "Yelp" before but I believe in giving credit where credit is due. Highly recommended BBQ! And they offer the same service for events.”
- “This was my first time here and it was awsome! Football on the big screen, live music, and great food. They have a huge selection of beers, tap and bottle as well as a large selection of bourbons. I had the St Louis ribs, Mac and cheese and biscuits. The ribs were falling off the bone, moist and meaty. The mac and cheese was ok, could use some seasoning. The biscuits were on the dry side but dip them in sauce and they're pretty good. My friends had brisket, pulled pork, greens, potatoe salad and coleslaw. They said their food was very good. We will be back.”
- “Great bbq lunch at brother johns on n stone. Casually and stylishly remodeled former wildcat house with full walled long bar with two tall chalk boards of beers and told large whiskey choices also. Comfortable booths & tables indoors and out. I had the meat plus one side lunch (9.5$$)with wonderful moist tender juicy brisket and Mac and cheese also pulled pork piled high with spicy cup of chili . There where 5 regional choices of sauces . Kit the friendly knowledgeable server helped me through the menu . Manager Greg very helpful and professional also thank you both. The tables are moved out for music I hear it's a fun nighttime club experience too. I will definitely return to try  more menu items. Try it ! ( Greg manager said they use some local Dickmans beef , saw their ugly steak but not sure if all beef is dickmans? Hamburger s ? The brisket was great)”

- “What a disappointment.  The article in Caliente magazine promised a truly great BBQ experience with its  state-of-the-art Southern Price Smokers.  I was excited.  I judge BBQ, especially brisket, based on my many years living in Texas where they do do brisket better than anywhere else.  Tucson hasn't had a brisket to match, and it still doesn't.    I lunched at Brother John's the same day the Caliente article was published.  You'd think that they would put their best foot forward for the many expected readers trying the place for the first time. The environs were promising with its spacious high ceillings. I ordered, what else, the brisket.  What i was served was a very dry and hard piece of meat.  I was there for an early lunch and my first thought was I got some leftover meat from the day before.  It really did have the look of beef sliced last night and reheated next morning.  If it wasn't leftovers, it is pretty poor smoking skills.  The skill of the pitmaster is taking a tough cut of meat as brisket is and making it tender through hours in a well tempered smoker.  Nothing doing here.  I also was disappointed in the corn bread that came with the brisket.  If I had not been told, I would not have identified it as corn bread.  It was bland and tasteless.  The whole meal left me sorely disappointed.”
- “Where do I start?  1.  Entrance to restaurant -- signage desperately needed showing where      to find the entrance. 2.  Red chairs in booth are quite uncomfortable. 3.  Lunch menu prices are outrageously over-priced. 4.  Food portions DO NOT match the price that you pay. We visited Brother John's for lunch and we were very disappointed.  Since this is a brand new venue in the UofA/Downtown area we were excited to try it out.  As you can see we were very disappointed.  We ordered and anxiously waited for our meals to arrive. I ordered the barbecue brisket and my friend ordered the St Louis ribs, she also wanted corn bread but to our surprise, the cost for corn bread was $3.50, YIKES!  No corn bread for her!   When our meals arrived...we were quite surprised to see the small portions (for such a BIG price)!  My brisket was good, again -- it wasn't delectable and I have had better.  My friend claimed that her ribs were "good", but again, not "to die for."    Management needs to do re-think, re-evaluate and re-group.”
- “We had previously been to this restaurant twice when there was no crowd.  They have a limited menu, but the ribs were great and served quickly.  So last night we decided to take some friends.  They were having an event, but they told us we would be the next to be seated.  We were seated 45 minutes later.  There was an empty table visible to us the entire time that was never filled while we were there.  After we ordered it took 60-90 minutes to get our food.  The sides were brought out 10-15 minutes before the rest of the food, so the mashed potatoes were cold by the time the food came.  We were given a free appetizer - 3 small tacos for 4 people - at the same time our food was finally served.  We had ordered 2 plates of the baby back ribs, but it was obvious that one plate was the baby back and one plate was the St. Louis ribs.  We showed up at 6 and got our food at 8:30; even with good company, by then there was no way to enjoy the meal.”

## Tips from customers

Best BBQ in Tucson coming from a Texan The best small rib on Tucson New Tucson favorite! Great food, wonderful staff, tasty drinks. Great BBQ, perfect smoke on the ribs and really good food! Not super excited about anything. Was very pricey for what we got, and we were convinced they left out an ingredient in the cornbread because that's how bad it tasted. Good BBQ brisket is nice and fatty Great selection of food, beers and whiskey!  Great see also.

- “The ice cream here is always delicious but this time my bf and I decided to take it home and while my bf was eating it he pulled a hair out of his mouth of course it was gross. So he went on to continue eating it because it was delicious and unfortunately he pulled out another piece of long hair but this time he was able to see it on the spoon before putting it in his mouth so then he threw away the ice cream. Luckily there was none in mine but 2 in his! They really need to be more careful and more clean and keep their hair up! That's just disgusting!”
- “They cheat you on your mix in's when you place your order online. You're not there to see until you get home and realize you overpaid for toppings that you barely got. Complained on their site, I then got a call from Lisa Gies stating that she did a good job training the manager from this store who happens to be the one that prepared my ice cream. She asked if I had proof that there were little mix ins (smh). I couldn't believe it! Arguing over some mix ins. I decided to end the conversation. There's definitely bigger problems in the world than to be arguing with upper management over mix ins!!!! Sticking to our regular location on Wetmore.”
- “Service was great and ice cream is great but the employees are in there with the heat at 100 degrees, outside is even colder than inside the store. every single customer in the store with me complained about the heat and had to eat their almost melted completely ice cream outside. I wish I had a managers contact information. Just because you pay them minimum wage doesn't mean you don't check on what will make them comfortable while they work.”

## Tips from customers
Coffee Lovers mix. I had that on my first visit and as far as I'm concerned, that's all there is. Cake Batter ice cream is the best flavor! Get the oatmeal cookie batter and the cake batter mixed together

- “This is not directed towards Dr. Mitchell, who seems like a very proficient and caring optometrist. Rather, it is geared towards the optical department personnel.   I purchased some very pricey lenses from this place. They were Essilor Varilux Physio Enhanced 1.74 with Crizal anti-reflective coating. They were about $600 ... for lenses only. Within a few months, the lenses developed scratches and swirls. The anti-reflective coating was supposedly the issue. They were replaced under warranty. Second pair were fine for a few weeks and then started having the same issues.Since I am primarily a contact lens  wearer, I wear my glasses only in the evening for about 3-4 hours. I decided not to bother. A few months went by and by now they were out of warranty. Fast forward about 2 years to the present.   Today I contacted them and spoke with an optician at this place. I wasn't calling to complain but mentioned that I did not want to order the same lenses and tried to understand whether I should expect the same thing again. What followed was pretty shocking. At first she said I had probably left them in the heat. I told her that these were being worn in the evening at home. Then she said that they were probably in a very humid environment. I live in one of the driest places on the planet. Next she suggested that they may have been lying under my bed on the floor. I asked her if she was joking and she didn't respond to that. Then she asked me if they were being stored in a case. I said they were typically on the nightstand next to my bed. She said they should always be in a case and that is most likely I was having problems. There was an undeniable tone of hostility in her voice. I repeated that I wasn't asking for a replacement but I didn't want to have the same issues again. At that point she disconnected me .... end of story!  I haven't mentioned any names here; however, I have dealt with 3 opticians in this store and none of them seem to have any customer service skills.”
- “Lame receptionists. The manager lady is rude.  She wouldn't give my son an emergency pair of contacts for his hs graduation after all the money we spent. We had to go elsewhere and then she called back hours later and said we could. Too late. The whole phone call w her was rude.  Not sensitive at all.  Telling me to "calm down" when I was calm and said we just need one pair for tonight. They lost our business that day. Prices are not great. Their hours are weird sometimes. The guy just stands there and ignores you even if you knock not knowing their hours.   Eclipse was about to happen. They sent out an email come and get yours (glasses for the eclipse) which we didn't get until that morning. Went to get the glasses and they were closed.  The eclipse happened and they (the man w glasses who works there) wouldn't open the door. Lol.  We missed out on that.  Great!  They seem to hate working there.  Or hate working period.”
- “It takes a very long time to get an appointment. The office is clean and the staff is friendly. The equipment seems very up to date. You don't have to get the puff of air in your eyes - which is awesome. My problem is that my perscription is wrong. I am trying to make a follow up appointment to get rechecked and appointments are a month out. So I have to struggle with the wrong perscription for six weeks, which is really affecting my everyday life. I paid almost $700 for glasses and when I finally get my new perscription, I am going to need to buy new lenses. I am very disappointed and wish I would have stuck to my previous optometrist. Employee Kathy is an absolute nightmare. She does not belong in customer service. is rude and impatient. Refuses to answer questions and even walks away from you mid-conversation. She is the reason that my family and I will never be back. Save your time and money and go elsewhere for your vision needs.”

## Tips from customers
There seems to be a lot of legitimate good reviews not being recommended by yelp. Including my own. Great service! Went above and beyond. Very convenient location too.

- “super fast service, nice and easy!  very clean shop and extra friendly staff...plus they have a huge selection of rare keys.  my first time in and i will be back!!!  thanks guys!”
- “Called around and discovered this was one of the few places that could help me. Went in and could not have been more pleased. Honest service. Kind help and not overpriced for their work. Originally had a broken into car door lock. Ended up also bringing in another car that needed lock help. Fina is amazing!!!”

- “I am not one to write reviews good or bad but felt in this case the people need to know to avoid this company at all costs. I have been using C&S locksmith for over 30 years and the new ownership is terrible. I would not recommend using them at all for any reason.  I stopped in to get 6 of my own keys cut and the owner told me it would be 65.00 each to just cut keys for a few vehicles and I did not even need them programmed. When I asked why so much he proceeded to tell me because the machine cost him $10,000 and was extremely rude about it. Personally I am a business man myself know it costs to stay in business, however there is no need to be rude about it. I really don't care if the machine cost $100,000 that is not my problem and I did not tell you to buy it. When they were at the old location and the original owners owned C&S  were polite and courteous always. This joker is a real asshole and should not be in business at all. I wish I had read the reviews first before trying to do business with this guy. Oh well live and learn. Didn't know things had gone down hill this much. Buyer beware!!!!”
- “These guys are very sarcastic and talk down to their customers. Prices are the highest in town”
- “Went in to get a automobile key cut at $45 a key. And I have the blanks. I told them I would go to AAA Locksmith and the told me they are out of business. And they aren't. C&S seems to be dishonest and overpriced as AAA will do it for half the price.”

## Tips from customers
Amazing service, quick arrival competitive pricing  and very friendly. Thanks again Thomas! Meh,  they're OK.   Price gouge a little but they get the job done. Quick walk in service for a reasonable price. What more can you ask for?

- “The best service in town! They know me when I walk in and are ready to take care of me.  They always have what I want in stock and any suggestions are based on what they know I like.  If a product malfunctions, it's replaced and upgraded immediately.  They know vaping, they know quality, they are knowledgeable about the industry and keep ahead of the trend.  A smaller shop with BIG service!”

- “Terrible experience, the only person in there that knew what they were talking about was a knowegable young lady and the owner continued to ignore . My girlfriend had issues with the kit we had just bought 2 days before. He had every excuse in the book as to why it wasn't working correctly. If he would have just said "Oh yeah I see what the issue is" and excepted that there was something wrong with the product he sold us, we probably would have kept giving him our business. Instead he accused me of abusing my e cig. I took it in, there was not 1 scrach on it and he told me that the problem was the coil and he would replace it. In the time that he was replacing the coil, the tank acquired a scrach as soon as he saw that, he told me that it was abused. Just a heads up if something goes wrong the excuses will start rollin!!!!!!”

## Tips from customers
I initially started going here because a few items are cheaper compared to freedom smoke and it's also closer to where I live. But every time I go I feel like the service is lackluster and they could really care less about informing me on certain things. It seems like they just want my money and that's about it, you can't even taste flavors!! I'll be taking my business elsewhere from now on. There under new management, I bet you will be surprised.

- “Horrifyingly aggressive driver. I observed a driver for this company with a car loaded on the flatbed tailgating with less than a foot of following distance going 75 or 80 in a 55 mile per hour construction zone, crowding people out of lanes onto the shoulder, tailgating with highbeams, and laying on the horn while tailgating two different vehicles during that five minutes or so I was unfortunate enough to be within a couple hundred yards of this guy. My money says no way this guy can pass a tox  screen. Somehow I survived and now I live to warn you. If you do business with these people my guess is your money is going straight to some kind of substance abuse. Really, I've never seen anything like it in my entire life.”

- “We have come to this restaurant several times over the last 5-6 years. I have written a review before, but wanted to write another from our most recent event. We had a party of 14 people attending for my husband's birthday. Every person left saying their meal was wonderful and service was excellent. I also appreciated the restaurant acknowledging my husband's birthday by bringing out a wonderful dessert for him. The entire evening was memorable and enjoyable!”
- “Tucson is a wonderful place for dining.  We have eaten twice at Catalina BBQ and both times it has been easily 5 Star!  When you walk in the aromas will make you hungry and you'll know that it will be great eating experience. The first visit it was Brisket Sandwich.  The brisket was tender and delicious, the bread was beautifully toasted and delicious.  The side salad was quite lovely also.  The second visit was a Catalina Cheese Burger.  The finest cheeseburger I have had in a few years.  Mildly spicy that made it all the better.  With the addition of Onion Rings it was a perfect dinner.  I highly recommend this restaurant all the way from the aromas to the dinner and the wait staff was superb.”
- “Great place. Service is outstanding, catered to what we wanted to eat even when it wasn't on the menu, the made it happen. Very willing to change television so we could watch the game. The pulled pork is AMAZING. Highly recommend it. This is a gem of your in the area stop by for a good meal. The French fries are crisp and delicious.”

- “This will be the 1 & only visit to this place...hands down the WORST service! Arrived from out of town to enjoy some quality BBQ & views with a friend to be vaguely greeted & told to "sit anywhere you'd like & a server will be right there". After selecting a spot on the patio (in full view of staff), we waited for about 10 minutes before I reentered the main dining hall in search of staff, to no avail. I then went to the unattended host station to help myself to a menu & returned to my patio seat in hopes of being prepared to order once a server finally would appear. This however did not occur so after another 10 minutes or so of looking through the menu --waiting for a server-- I again went back inside, this time I went to the bar to at least begin with a drink order & confirm that a server would be coming. This is when I was greeted by the most unfriendly & seemingly disgruntled bartender available. Rather than saying hello or even anything basically or remotely hospitable, I received an annoyed "what can I get you"? I asked about any happy hour specials & about the server situation. With an attitude, she replied that tap beers were on sale & that "the server will be there shortly". I explained to her that we had been waiting for approximately 20 minutes at that point without anyone or anything. The bartender said she's been "really busy" (with the only 4 or 5 patrons in the bar/dining area-whom had clearly already been tended to as they were wrapping up) & then asked where we were seated & I directed her attention to the patio directly in front of her. She then said that was her section & she'd be right there to take an order & bring water. I thought fair enough at that point, maybe she's just having a bad day...but then it continues.  Bartender finally brings water & abruptly & confusedly takes order. After a few moments, another staff member delivered our meal order. My friend, who does not eat pork or beef because of specific dietary needs, specifically asked if there was any meat in the beans. The server promptly & confidently said "no, not at all". We took the server's word to be true & proceeded to eat. The meal was tasting very good & things seemed to be taking a turn towards an improved experience until we realized that there was in fact meat in the beans. Too late because my friend had already ingested it & immediately began to feel nauseous. My friend had excused herself to the restroom to vomit. This is when I asked the bartender to check with the kitchen regarding the meat in the beans only to be confirmed. As I then told the bartender that we specifically asked the server if meat was in the beans, the bartender defensively scoffed as she argued that she was our server & we never asked her that, to which I responded that I was talking about the server who delivered our food. The bartender then said "oh, she's new". This is simply not acceptable as it is the primary job of any server to know the menu & be aware of dietary needs when providing service (none of this was supplied by the server). Being naive & disconcerned is not an excuse for making people sick, especially in the food & service industry. The bartender offered to get the manager, so I accepted. After aprising the manager of the situation, her only solution was an insincere apology & offer of a complimentary dessert. Seriously, this level of treatment is ridiculous! At this point, my ill friend voiced that she simply wanted to leave. Rather than appropriate compensation, the manager went to fetch the bill. This should have been a positive memory to enjoy, but instead it was an absolutely terrible experience & I am beyond frustrated that we had to pay full price for it. For a renowned golf course resort/restaurant to treat its guests in such a fashion is inexcusable. With all this being said, I hope that the Catalina Barbeque Company learn & improve from all the mistakes. I know I will as I would recommend for others to seek other destinations for quality food & service.”
- “Service was extremely slow. Its 90 degrees and water wasn't served until 30 minutes after. The aroma of the outdoor patio was that of fertilizer. The restaurant was not full. I chose to come here because of the star rating. We should of stuck to JW marriot's restaurants.”
- “1 star only because 0 isn't an option. Had the worst dining experience ever. Scenery does look nice, but isn't enough to mask the stench of sewage inside the dining room. My family and I decided to sit outside because we couldn't handle the smell. This did not work in our favor, however. Flies were all over the place. The appetizer we ordered didn't look appetizing at all. We ordered the nachos and left shortly after. The nachos were absolutely drenched in cheese sauce, so much so that the chips were soggy. There was no way we were going to continue eating bad food and swat flies throughout our meal. Please do yourselves a favor and do not even bother considering this restaurant. It's just not worth it.”

## Tips from customers
Layer cake Zinfandel was wonderful 19th Hole ; ) Time to re-hydrate !!!! Divine chicken wings!  Happy hour!  Great service. This place is great for BBQ wings.. It's not greasy just perfectly smoked. And the three sauces on the side add a wonderful flavor. But the wings are great naked too. Don't recommend the New York strip. Very chewy. Blue bacon mash, yummy! Nachos are amazing, meat is smoked in house, ask for the regular fries to be seasoned and def try the sweet potato fries! Portions are huge, so is the price Great bbq and the spinach salad is so good. Corn muffins and the butter are fantastic. Melissa the waitress is fantastic. So polite. Rum punch is yummy! Try the brisket burnt ends! Meat loaf always awesome. short ribs are tops. Found a great BBQ restaurant in Tucson. Meat was very tender I made my review as a tip - oops! Everything was super delicious !! Great family-friendly and wallet friendly in comparison to other restaurants at Starr Pass. Get the nachos, mac n cheese, and pulled pork. That is all. Watch out for the Javalinas (Wild Boar). Were eating tonight and one of them came up right next to us on the patio! Very funny. Good food. Chicken a bit dry.

- “Great food. Great concept. Thanks Firehouse for providing reasonably priced quality food and supporting our community.  Our whole family loves this place.”
- “I think I just found my new favourite sub shop!. The most tender white turkey breast I've ever tasted with melted provolone cheese, fresh shredded lettuce, with extra Mayo, and heated up inside a soft fresh roll. Absolute heaven!”
- “This place is great.  Each time I've been there the place was packed, the service was quick, and the food was delicious. I love the corned beef sandwich, and their BBQ sauce is to die for.  They also have a really cool soda machine that will vend different flavors of soda, I'm assuming with some sort of syrup to mix in.  All in all this is a great place for a great lunch at just under $10 for the whole kit and caboodle.”

- “We went to the Firehouse Subs near Orange Grove and River Rd near Tucson.  I truly wouldn't even give this place a 1 star review.  We ordered two subs that were supposed to be hot.  The only thing they did was today the bread.  Sandwich meat and cheese was cold...directly out of the fridge.  We would have sent it back, but we waited more than 20 minutes for this poor imitation of a sandwich.  We used to eat at Firehouse often when we lived in the DC area.  I'm not sure we will ever eat here again.  Don't waste your time.  Jersey Mike's and Baggins are much better.”
- “It was my first time experiencing Firehouse Subs, and I will never go back. To begin with, they had three employees and none of them greeted us. It would be excusable if it was busy, however we were one of three couples in the place. I had never been and spent a good amount of time scanning the menu, in that time I wasn't asked if I had any questions about the menu or shown how it generally works. My girlfriend wondered aloud about the sizing, and all three employees ignored us until I explicitly asked. Our food didn't take much time, though I would have waited longer for a meal with more care. Our sandwiches were haphazardly thrown in the bag. I had the club, which looked good, but all I could taste was mayo and sweetness. The honey ham overpowered the entire sandwich. The bacon was wet and limp. It seemed microwaved. My girlfriend's New York Steamer was a mushy disaster. It tasted like a microwaved gas station sandwich. We are pretty easy going in regards to food and typically give restaurants more than one try but this experience was awful all around.”
- “Absolutely terrible service. DO NOT order the "salad" as it looks NOTHING like the image. Who made my salad, a 3rd grader? The photo has veggies, peppers, and other items included. I received nothing other than plain chopped lettuce. This is twice in two weeks, and previous salads we ordered looked way better. Awful. Dont even deserve one star. See photo of 3rd graders salad. When I called, I was told "Go right ahead" after I was denied a refund and told them I would write this review.”

## Tips from customers
First time here! SOOOOO good!!! Place is super clean. And plenty  of seating. And a huge selection of hot sauces Best subs ever. The New York sub is awesome. No soda at all. Said machine down. Epic Fail!  Huge disappointment. I had to wait about 5 minutes in line to use their fancy soda machine which then would only give me Diet Dr Pepper. The place was full. Sandwich was good. Italian one of the best subs Whole menu is awesome!!!! I absolutely love this place!! Great food, and good atmosphere. So yummy!!! Trade-off: a bajillion soda flavors for a redbox-style wait in line. Great selection of drinks (they have one of those new Coke machines) and hot sauces Love this place! Great sandwiches! Love the hot sauce bar. Great sandwich. Made with love. Staff was attentive. Omg. Their soda machine is crazy! The most amazing drink dispenser. 120+ flavor combinations!! King's Hawaiian Pork & Slaw sammy is delicious! Highly recommended. We need one of these out near Vail!!! Thank heaven we have one now!! Yummy The 12" Firehouse Hero with double meat is the best sub I've had since the old Greasy Tony's Weight Lifter days in college. Incredible! Great job Firehouse! Make sure you donate your change to the firemen - it doesn't hurt! Everything is great

The waitresses are standard diner waitresses: over friendly when they're not ignoring you and telling you to refill your own coffee. I'm kidding...or am I?!? It's nice fun casual dining experience and the cooks are awesome and quick.”

- “Becoming my favorite breakfast place. Steak and eggs with hash browns, French toast, Strawberry waffles, eggs Benedict. All of your favorites are here. But what makes it special are the people, the management, wait staff and cooks makes everyone feel special and at home. Can't wait for next weekend.”

- “I've been to this location a few times, though the service I received this past week was so horrible that I don't know that I'll go back.  I arrived and the place wasn't too busy.  My waitress seated me and asked if I'd like anything to drink.  I responded, "Coffee please" and she was on her way.  I began to look at the menu and, ultimately, realized that my waitress wasn't coming back.  After several minutes I asked another young lady if I could get some coffee and she replied that she'd 'find' my waitress.  Great, that would be great.     Well, another five minutes passed and then I saw her.  She was filling other people's coffee mugs up as she made her way up the isle, then went to the front of the restaurant two seat two other couples that arrived.  After seven or eight minutes I had no water, coffee... attention... anything, though others were being seated, served and waited on.  I, literally, had to ask if I could PLEASE get... Anything!  Like, anything.  There was an older gentleman seated next to me who said, "I can see you, though you must be invisible to them."  I guess so?  When my waitress did re-engage with me she asked, "What can I get you to drink?"  Really... what was that interaction when I arrived?  Were you having a stroke?  "Coffee.  I'd like some coffee please."  Because I thought I'd never see her again I ordered coffee, food, water... anything that I might want to come the next time she graced me with her presence.  The food was fine.  It's what you'd expect and nothing more.  Though when you're treated like the plague, the food doesn't taste all that great, to be sure.  Never again.  Perhaps it's good enough for Jerry Bob, though I don't have the time to hope someone comes and waits on me.  Horrible service that doesn't even deserve the one star I'm forced to give.”
- “My boyfriend and I went to jerry bobs recently and they completely forgot about us. We were the only ones in there and they didn't acknowledge us at all. The staff was talking to each other and we waited around 45 minutes for our bill. We usually enjoy the food and service but this time, the service was completely unacceptable. Even after waiting so long, the waitress never apologized or anything. We will not be going to this Jerry Bobs again, VERY poor customer service.”
- “We have come here for years and the last two times we have come we had to return our meals and they could have cared less if we were upset - so sad it's time to find a different breakfast place”

Wonderful little place, super friendly,  great eggs Benedict has gone down hill. sad

- “I've visited this place twice, and both times were positive experiences. The owner, Clarise, is a total sweetheart and extremely friendly to all customers. You can tell she takes a lot of pride in her shop. The free WiFi is great. Machines are plentiful and priced fairly. While I was there, she had a couple technicians working to bring up a washer that stopped working. I think she must keep them as close to 100% operational as she can.  The bathroom is spacious. Clarise also gave me a bottle of ice cold water Because she said I looked hot. I will be going back for sure.”

- “The owners are tobacco Smokers that smoke and vape on the premises, if you want to breathe in harmful second hand smoke this is your place. Check the sidewalk and parking lot, it's an ashtray for the owners addiction.   We used to spend $100+a month having laundry done here, no longer, as we don't want our health affected nor our clothing smelling of smoke, or to contain 3rd hand smoke. Plenty of other laundries in Tucson that don't put their clientele at risk.”
- “expensive as fuck and the machines if lids aren't closed they eat your cash. and they won't re emburse u. ridiculous”
- “Terrible service. I asked Karla the attendant to help me with settings on a machine that was all electronic.  I was washing a down coat and told her I needed cold water and a gentle cycle. She started the machine and pressed gentle cycle after which she attempted without success to switch from warm water settings to cold. When she realized that cannot be done, she blamed it on me saying that I had asked for the gentle cycle. She obviously did not know how use the machine. She told me she had no way of turning off the machine. She did not apologize for her incompetence and also made rude comments about me.  She refused to give me the cell of the owner. I did send an email to the address provided by the counter but never heard back from the owners. This was more of a New York experience but very unusual for Tucsonian hospitality.  Trashy and unpleasant place and my jacket did get damaged.”

## Tips from customers
Why is it 5 bucks for your blankets. Wont be back. Go before 7p so you can roam around at twice as nice next door while your laundry's in. Clean and professional Laundromat!! Very clean facility and very nice staff. Air conditioning a big plus.

- “I've been shopping here for the last four years now on and off. Original came here for a suit that I was hesitant on but the staff was incredibly helpful in finding me just what I wanted. Also weirdly enough, great place to buy jeans with killer deals on them.   Just bought another two suits from here and got them tailored this time. Best part? Any alterations are free for the life of the garment. They will even do it on short notice too. Which was great when I got a little too wide for slacks and I had a interview in four days. Super accommodating.”
- “Have to give a shout out to Men's Wearhouse On Oracle in Tucson and especially manager Nick. Their sister store JosBanks on Ina/Oracle  had great sale a while back. I bought 4 suits normally listed at $1000 each. Their tailor utterly destroyed two with his shitty trailering!!  The others eventually were finished but so tight it did not leave any room for a couple extra lbs. I should have known from the tailors skin tight pants that he sucked.   The fix, took to men's warehouse and manager Nick and his Taylor fixed all to satisfaction. The store is a bit understaffed but they do take your needs seriously. If anyone in the company is listening, your Taylor's are as important as the quality of your product. I am totally turned off at the whole JosBanks adventure. Although I have been s big fan of Men's Warehouse for many years, this has sealed the deal for me. Nick and his Oracle store is my go to clothing store.   As for JosBsnks, your claim to be an "upper end store is bullshit.”
- “We had a great experience getting accessories (shirts, ties, shoes, belt) for our wedding! Nick, the manager, patiently helped us out and made it a smooth experience, giving input where needed and keeping things light and easy. The store was very clean and organized, and all the staff were friendly.”

- “Probably the worst retail experience of my life. I went in to get a couple shirts and within 2 minutes I had a salesman clamoring down my throat, pushing custom shirts whilst preaching the divinity of monograms and cuff links on everything.       'You mean you don't want cuff links on your shirts? But look at how cool these gold cuff links are... Okay, I could probably monogram your boxers for you sir... Cuff linked socks are all the rage right now, I bet you'd love them... Oh, well I'm sure some monogrammed backless chaps would look great with a suit. Did I mention we sell custom suits? Oh well we do... Sure, but if you ever do want one then custom is the way to go, I can even get you started with a monogrammed one today for the low low price of your dignity and self respect.'      I've purchased cars in a lower pressure environment. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of letting him order me some custom shirts. I was told they'd be here within 4-6 weeks. I called three times within that period, no shirts. I called again after 2 months, and they told me my salesman called a couple days ago (once) and left me a message. That phone call doesn't exist is MY records, but I'll take their word for it.       So I finally went in to pick up the shirts, and every one of them was too tight. To the credit of the manufacturer, they did look and feel nice, and I probably would've kept them if they fit. But they don't fit at all. In fact the fit is so bad that they can't be fixed with tailoring.       The manager told me I could either reorder the shirts, which "can't be rushed" and will take another six weeks, or take a refund. Of course they didn't ask how I would like that refund, so they refunded my paid-off credit card rather than writing me a check. Now my money is stuck in limbo until I call my bank to sort that out. They made no effort to compensate for the fact that they held my money for over 8 weeks and did not deliver a satisfactory product.       Tl;dr: Pushy salesman, shirts took significantly longer to arrive than promised, shirts didn't fit, terrible customer service, still out 350 bucks for the time being.”
- “Okay so have to start with the positives. I purchased a beautiful suit for my 18 year old son. We dealt with an assistant manager and he was knowledgeable and professional. He knew what he was doing, gave advise and sold us a great suit. I was even planning to return to buy my 21 year old his suit in the next few weeks after the great buy.   So why the bad review???   Deep breath, well when we showed up at our set appointment time to pick up the suit we were ignored. Not only when we walked in but after standing at a register for 20+ minutes and after asking at least two employees for assistance. I finally stopped an employee and asked if I could just pick up a suit that was ready no longer needed to try it on just wanted to pick it up and pay for a tie and accessories. Waited several more minutes then when he returned with the suit it wasnt even in a bag or anything, not sure if this is normal but the store on Broadway puts them in bags. I asked him if I could pay for the items and he said well I reccomend you stand at the register until someone sees you. I asked if they provide a bag and did not get an answer.  I understand they were busy, because they were, but no reason to not even acknowledge a customer. I again waited by the register and nothing so put the items back walked out and went to purchase them at a different store.   The purchase started with 5 stars but then went to zero, very disappointing. If someone, anyone would have said even hello or be right with you or sorry we are busy or hey is there any way you can come back no problem I get it but I got nothing.”
- “I would give this store zero stars if I could. NEVER have I had a worse shopping experience than here. When I went with my groomsmen to pick up our suits for my wedding, the staff was moving extremely slow, and as a result there were several customers aside from us who were waiting for service - all while there were staff members just standing around. What should have been a 15-20 minute process (trying on the suits to verify fitment, and paying), took almost 90 minutes. What makes it worse is that the staff forgot to put one of the pairs of shoes in one of the bags and when we went back the next day to pick them up we again ran into problems. What should have taken 30 seconds this time took about 10-15 minutes. The staff just stood around and were refusing to help my groomsman, because one of the staff was busy chatting it up with his buddy. When my groomsman tried to ask for help, the staff member held up a finger at him with an attitude as he couldn't be bothered to place his non-professional conversation on hold to help a paying customer. HIGHLY DISSATISFIED.”

- “Great jeweler, nice, helpful people. It is a tic more expensive than other jeweler selections, but it is worth it. You know you're getting quality and you know you're talking to someone that wants to help you. It is exactly how a business should be run.”
- “Amazing service! I went here to get a nice watch for myself. I was treated with the utmost respect and service the whole time. I chose a Tag Heuer after trying on about eight different watches. Then, I was having major buyer's remorse and went back the next day to exchange my Tag Heuer for another I had tried on. No questions asked, no hassle. They let me choose the one I wanted and did the exchange quickly and with amazing service. Highly recommended.”
- “I went to Jared on Brodway street with confidence because I read the good reviews here . I called and Sharon was very knowledgeable about the watch problem I was having and told me to stop by and she will know how to help me . When I arrived it was late in the pm hours I was greeted by the manager Heidi who immediately offer to help me! She was so down to earth and nice that we started to talk like old friends. In the same time , expertly she was working on my watch. I felt so confident in her expertise and at the same time I experienced friendship from first encounter.  When Sharon came she joined us and we looked at some beautiful diamond settings. It was an amazing nice and comfortable experience. I would recommend this Jared store to anyone because of the way the costumer is made comfortable And the  expertise of everyone working there . This is the store that I will visit again. Thank you Heidi and Sharon !!!”

- “I took a beloved heart necklace (designed by my husband who passed away recently) to this location to be repaired. When I returned to pick it up they couldn't find it. I could see some of the jewelers through the workroom window combing through assorted bins and shrugging their shoulders. No one seemed to know where it was or which of the six jewelers had been working on it. Just as I was starting to panic one of them reached under a work bench and produced it. And it had not been repaired. The clerk told me they would hastily repair it now but I asked for it back. I didn't want a hasty repair. It appears they have a sloppy system for keeping track of customers jewelry or no system at all. I won't be returning to Jared's.”
- “I cannot say enough bad things about this place. My husband made the mistake of buying my wedding set here, thinking it was the best. They offer 0% financing for a year on purchases and lifetime warranty and cleaning so he thought it was a great deal.   1. They are over-priced. You believe you are getting a good deal but you are not. They have to pay for their big stores somehow and it comes out in their prices.   2. They nickel and dime you for everything. Nothing is included EVEN THOUGH THEY TELL YOU IT IS. I need to have an official appraisal for our insurance and they wanted $120. We went to a VERY reputable jeweler, Silverberg and Sons, and they did it for less than half that and it wasn't their ring. I was quoted $19 to have his band engraved and when I went to pick it up I was told they charged $55. We were told they were solder my rings together after the wedding and when we went back they wanted $109. Again, took it to Silverberg and they charged only for the gold.   3. They took us with their financing. He put a down payment down, signed up for the 1-year 0% on the remaining balance and setup automatic payments to ensure it was paid off prior to. Instead of $525, they only took $25 for the final payment and did not send a monthly statement. Unfortunately we were busy GETTING MARRIED and going on our honeymoon and assumed they took the final payment correctly. My husband called to close the account since we shouldn't have had a balance and discovered they did not take the full last payment. Since it was 10 days past the year mark we were charged all of the back interest despite clear evidence there should have been no change in payment made and with our perfect payment history.   I really wanted to love them because my husband did. He got my wedding set, two rings and some Pandora stuff here but we won't spend another dime in this store.”
- “This store is a complete disappointment. I have bought many pieces of jewelry at this chain over the years including my wedding ring that has a 1 1/2 carat diamond. When we purchased it records were not kept electronically. As a result, whenever I take the ring in to clean or fix, they question whether I purchased it at Jared. A month ago, I took it in because the diamond was loose in its setting. I waited 25 minutes for them to "verify" I purchased it there. They act like I'm lying. We go thru this EVERY time we go in. Finally found the receipt and said they'd update the records. When my husband picked up the "fixed" ring, they questioned whether we'd bought it there. I've since taken it to another jeweler to have it cleaned and he said the tips of the prongs were worn down. Jared should have seen this and corrected it. In short, DO NOT SHOP AT JARED. They do not value their customers.”

They will clean your rings free of charge. :) Best jewelry store and great people

- “Great deals, and the owners are really friendly. The car I bought from here was a great deal, low mileage, and in good shape.”
- “Best car buying experience I've had. Al not only was able to work with us on pricing, but buffed out scratches on our other car for free, took care for taking the car for emissions, and had the car delivered to our house. I've been looking for a while and could not find a better deal and an easier person to work with. It was a real pleasure doing business with A.P.'s Auto. I would have never thought of buying a car from a smaller dealership like this had it not been for the fact that A.P.'s is a certified USAA dealership.”
- “This dealership is small but has a good selection of cars. Al made the car buying experience easy and straightforward. We never felt pressured or misled. We were happy to be able to support this local neighborhood business. We got a great deal and Al made sure we got the best interest rates and insurance by making some phone calls himself . We will definitely return for routine maintenance in the future. Car fax report was also provided.”

- “Whatever you do do NOT give this business money to hold a vehicle. There was no contract and now he won't give our money back. Claims to be an upstanding company. I don't agree..he's out to take advantage of anyone he can. Be careful!!”
- “My husband and I rented a car for our employee whose car broke down this past Saturday. The only reason AP Auto was chosen was because they were located close to the auto repair shop.  The car was fixed the next day, on Sunday.  However, since AP Auto was not open on Sunday, nor was there a parking lot to leave the car, it was parked and remained at the repair facility (unused) until it could be returned on Monday.    On Monday, upon returning the car and reviewing the return receipt, our employee saw that the return date on the receipt was incorrect and asked that it be fixed.  She was told by the owner and his wife (Al & Elly) they would not change it and that "It did not matter" and they subsequently were both very rude to her.   She was upset about how horribly she was treated and called me. So I called and Elly was also rude to me. I did ask if the return details could be corrected and if a credit was possible since the car was only used a half day and returned to them almost 2 days early.  I was told a refund was not possible--and I accept that.   HOWEVER, NOT GETTING A REFUND IS NOT THE REASON WHY I'M WRITING A NEGATIVE REVIEW. The owner is INCORRECT in stating I "demanded" a refund. I asked if it was possible before I was abruptly told it was "my problem not hers!"   I am mostly upset that the store owner was harsh and rude to a customer (my employee and myself) when asked if the return date/time could be fixed to reflect the correct date and time. The reason we wanted the receipt fixed was because having an incorrect return date/time on the receipt makes my employee (the renter) and me/my husband (the one's paying the bill) liable for any damage to the car after it was officially returned.   It is unacceptable for any business to falsely misrepresent information on a receipt and react rudely to the customer when asked to fix it. In hindsight, it would have been better for us, to take our business to a rental car company that was located much further away and even cost more, to ensure the rental details were accurate, there would not be a potential liability issue, and most importantly that we would be treated nicely.     Lastly after posting this review the owner is now threatening to go after me for writing this review instead of trying to resolve the issue (i.e. fix the receipt) and/or apologize for the mean treatment.  I do have a copy of the incorrect receipt and testimony from our employee on how she was treated. You can see in the attached photo how the receipts indicates the rental car was returned  tomorrow at 6/7/2016 4:13:58 PM (instead of the correct date/time of this morning 6/6/2016 at 9:00 AM).”
- “Got into the airport and called to check the reservation I made. A guy answered the phone and sounded shocked there was a reservation made for today because they were closed. He checked and there was indeed a reservation showing for us. He said didn't understand why the system even let us make a reservation and "don't know what I can do for you... maybe get a rental car" and hung up on me. One star for answering the phone or we would have paid for a ride to their location only to find them closed.”

Great small dealership. Has an excellent selection and was a pleasure to work with. We love our new car.

- “DH and I were going to go to the fair today, but apparently admission didn't start until 2. We needed to get gas, so backtracked over to the Qwik Mart to fill up and get some snacks and drinks.   On my way back to the car, I tripped on some uneven pavement and went flying. My sunglasses fell off, the Coke Zero I got went rolling merrily on it's way, but the Crystal Light packets, M&Ms and bottled water stayed inside the bag. Go figure!   A very nice young man in his early twenties clucked over me and pointed out my head was bleeding. I didn't even know until that moment (when I saw the blood on the pavement.) He handed me some paper towels, asked if I was all right, and a couple of other gentlemen who were older (fifty-ish) supplied some paper towels for my bleeding head as well.   I REALLY appreciate this. I felt all right after standing up so if not for the aid I got, I might have just tried to go home. As of this writing, I'm at St Joe's waiting to be seen.   The gas station itself is nice and clean, and they had hazelnut spread M&Ms! The five stars is really for the customers; I am sp thankful to you gentlemen for your attention and kindness today.”

I decided to stop here than my usual Gas Station by my home, for smokes,   The older white male was so rude and acting like I didn't know how to swipe my card?   I told him   I can read. thank u,     No offensive jerk but im not the one working at Gas Station.  U are   racist bigot..   Sorry buddy but if u don't like your job, take yourself to school and do something with your life.  My first time stopping there.  My last time  I be passing by in my Mercedes.    Thanks :)”

## Tips from customers
Before Vail became the culturally diverse urban center that it is today, there was Quik Mart.  And it's still here.  That damn construction is killing me, though. Staff is great and pretty good selection for a gas station. Perfect for stopping after a trip to Colossal Cave!

- “Just wonderful.   I don't know about you but I LOVE fresh bread. And they have their own bakery. Looking for a good breakfast or a yummy sweet after walking the river or shopping at the farmers market, this is the place for you.   Hungover? This is the place for you too! Enjoy a Bloody Mary and some good eating. Absolutely love this place. Don't forget the fresh squeezed orange juice.”
- “Absolutely love this place.  Wonderful food, great service.  (We had one visit where service was slow, but there had been a family emergency, and the short-handed staff apologized profusely.)  My husband and I have never had any food that we didn't think was amazing; as I frequently tell the staff, I think the chef could take a paper bag and turn it into ambrosia.  Tuesday is now "we're going to Ghini's for lunch, right?" in this household.  (Thanks to Dee, Sevena -did I spell that right? - and Matthew for excellent service on our most recent visit.) Also, kudos to Gabby and Raquel in the bakery - always friendly and smiling, and willing to explain whatever treat I'm looking at. I try to make the pastries I buy last at least a day or so.  Nope - pretty much eaten in 24 hours.  So good!!”

- “My wife and I decide to try the new Friday's menu this week and was it awful.  I had the roasted marrow.  It was a mess, two large segments of bone one having a core that was smaller than my little finger with nothing to extract the marrow.  I finally got a small spoon but had to use the handle to dig out the grossly undercooked marrow.  The other piece of bone had a larger core but it too was undercooked.  I haven't had marrow before but my understanding is that it is supposed to slide out of the bone.  Not even close.  I had ordered escargot as an appetizer and they had a metallic taste with undercooked garlic in the butter.  My wife ordered the shrimp with grits and the shrimp (all four of them) were tasteless but the grits were terrific.  My dish came with a salad which was adequate but not tossed.  Anyway, I'll stick to breakfast which I have had before and is quite good.”
- “Came in on Sunday hoping for a light brunch but got a simply awful experience. Filthy floors, tables and chairs. Everything on the menu is overpriced by at least $2 and uninspired. You could make any of it with your eyes closed.  We got the chocolate and vanilla coffees, blended on waitresses' recommendation, the apple chocolate crepe and hash browns. Again, the egg choices looked so elementary and "un-French" that there was no point to even trying them.  Crepe came out soggy and soaked in grease and syrup, hash browns were passable, coffees were average.  Only thing French about this place is the "du jour" on 1/2 the menu.  Not recommended for anything but closing down and trying again.”
- “Very disappointed with lunch today. Don't get me wrong, food was great but COVID safety practices were very limited. Social distancing is not enforced and they are crowding people in. I am sure they are struggling like almost all businesses but precautions are a must. As you know this is one of my most favorite places. But, we were crowed today with extra tables and much less than 6  feet between tables. Service is always great as is the food. But consider your health!  Be safe and if there are to many tables. Go somewhere else. Be safe!”

## Tips from customers
I like this place . Check it out. The staff is friendly and helpful. Homemade egg nog mmmmm. Bacon Pea Salad was fresh, light, and vibrant - perfect for a hot summer day! Wine down Wed. Wins bottles are 1/2 price. Great place for breakfast. Taking Ed for fathersday. To bad no international cycling events on the TV today. Lavender lemonade is heaven on earth. Awesome place to get fresh pastries, breakfast,  and lunch. Doggies are allowed in the patio dining area. Yummy yummy strawberry waffles! This may be the worst service I have ever received EVER! Wonderful! Went again, still Delightful! This place was awful. Poor man's Latin omelette. What a find! Yummy Broullard! Breakfast served all day Sat. & Sun. Get their loyalty punch card. You get $5 free after the 9th punch. Great breakfast spot. Little on the expensive but worth it. Very nice service every time I've been. Biscuits and gravy one of the best in town! Delicious food. They are busy today!! The Bakery isn't open on Sundays just the restaurant . Person we talked to at the counter was not very friendly : ( Great food. Crepes are fabulous. Very flavorful food. Ooh la laaaahhh Outstanding ! Tuesdays are tapas nights from 5-7. It's the only evening dinner is served. Menu changes every three weeks. Great kids menu Unhappy with experience. Waited 30 min to get in, 30min for food, and received bland fishy tasting french toast, along with super greasy hash browns tasting of old oil. The place was very dirty also, they had leftover plates in their decorative shelves behind diners. Won't be back Eggs Provençal! The best breakfast in Tucson. For breakfast, I had the Croque Madame w/ side salad....Rich had the omelette w/ marinated chicken & swiss. Our meals were delicious. The coffee is strong & aromatic. Then went to the bakery and took home palmiers, fruit tart & walnut w/ fig bread. All were wonderful. The food is tasty and fresh, prices are good, staff is attentive. I should come here more often The special was AMAZING. The apple rum crepes were wayyyy too sweet. The bloody mary's sucked and the service was slow though kind (on a sun Coffee is not great Dont come here super starving! Long wait. Get here early Tour de France on the flatscreen, plus tartines and cafe au lait. Perfect combo. The coffee is good and Gabby is pretty awesome. Mmm champagne and strawberry shortcake.... What a good night! We had mussels (ugh, salty) and escargot . Drinks: mojito (good) & hazelnut vodka fizz ... A nice day outside for dining! I love this place so much! The food is always delicious and the service excellent. A very tasty breakfast option! Dine in back open! Decisions, decisions: eggs Provençal or corned beef hash? You can't go wrong either way. $5 or less happy hour! :) What amazing experience the food was absolutely delicious. Eek on the coffee and the serving utensils. But bakery seems good Cold staff, decent food. If you want to be treated poorly this is the spot for you! Nice place, grate custom survive Sorry should have been 5 stars due to food, ambience n people Another great breakfast! Lunch with Amy. The lavender lemonade is so good. Its only served during the summer. I really was not at all impressed. I ordered the strawberry crepe and it came out almost in a soup like texture.  The older gentleman waiter seemed very annoyed at my critique and asked what I wanted instead.  On the second go around, I ordered the apple buttered rum French toast. It also came out with a soup like mixture atop the bread. I understand the rudeness since we were in a French restaurant and all, but if you're going to act like that, at least have French quality. Try the eggs provençal! 20.11 special This place was MOBBED this morning but the staff was terrific and got us or food quickly and it was great! Thanks Ghinni's!! Best breakfast I've ever had. Good food, nice vegi options Try the poor mans omelette... Very good. They reinforced their standing as one on Tucson's all time great breakfast spots! Dee the Manager really takes care of you! Breakfast We order the hash browns extra crispy and they are amazing! The the Italiano omelette is orgasmic! Fridays 3-8pm have great drink specials and a delicious menu! Great breakfast! The owners are super nice, too. The french toast and sausage is my favorite. Delicious home made food. Grass fed beef Always a long wait for food. Friendly service but not necessarily good service. Clear your schedule for an hour or so... Don't sit in the corners, flies hang out on the windows and bother you during your meal. Otherwise, lunch was tasty! Open from 8am on for Sunday brunch The Italiano omelette is the best! Great atmosphere! Food was alright. One of my favorites for an amazing breakfast. Closed Mondays Great food and service!!!! Excellent food and awesome service. Best crepes in town!! Bought a spinach quiche creme brûlée croissant a bear claw amazing bread yep, that about covers it :D now to go home and pig out I love the ambiance throwbacks gives.

- “I have used Sahuarita Plumbing twice now. This is our first year in this home. The first visit involved two toilet water values. The second visit involved a leaking shower head. Their pricing and service on the first job were both great. On the second job, the shower head leaked for a day when I called them. They got here the next day, but the leak had stopped. Sahuarita Plumbing took a look at the shower head, made a suggestion about what to do if it should happen again and left. These guys are very fair, efficient and friendly.”
- “Sonny and assistant arrived on time, evaluated my issues and  determined where clog was located and dislodged clog out in sewage line. Sonny also educated me on where all of my sewer access and flapper valve were located.  Sonny also gave me a quote for a new hot water heater. Both were courteous and resolved my issues quickly and at a reasonable price.”
- “What can I say.. this company really helped our family out. The owner sunny came out and did the job himself late into the after noon and did a wonderful job. My family and I are so grateful for his fast response. He was super affordable and a true pro. Thank you sunny for taking care of us. Will definitely use them for our future needs in plumbing.                             Thank you,                                The Gonzalez Family”

- “Be forewarned: Sahuarita Plumbing WILL NOT perform an emergency service on SUNDAYS! Their website completely misrepresents by falsely leading someone to think they will with the word 'emergency' included...   At least 'Sonny' called back, just to state he wouldn't come out and for that, I can appreciate the call but in reality, his company failed to hold true to his business model from an informative POV. Please note the included link as of 24 June 2018 states nothing about not being available on Sundays. [http://www.sahuaritaplumbing.com/contact-us/]  There is a Mr. John Corbitt who is a regular at Rancho Sahuarita and, finally came to the rescue for a 'emergency' service call.  **Update as of 14 July 2018. Mr. Sonny didn't seem to like his review and though, as you can read, was middle of the road and without being rude. Mr. Sonny sent a private message that crosses the boundaries of business etiquette and good form in business communication. From the private text he sent, he shreds any credibility of concern for his businesses image. As a business owner, you never, NEVER attack a private, paying customer, EVER. 'Sahuarita Plumbing' is a unprofessional and unprincipled business that acts out in a slapdash manner. Not to be dealt with again...”
- “I would love to give these guys a review, I ask for a price on doing a job, he said he would call back with pricing in the afternoon. Never called back. Hate when they say they will call you, but they don't...... I have better things to do with my time than wait for a call.”

- “This place has everything! There's absolutely no reason for it to have such a low rating. It's big, well-organized, and easy to shop and find what you need. Prices are all marked and the inventory is really impressive. I'm a home cook so I was just looking for new cake pans, but ended up with high-quality measuring cups, a teapot, and a big shaker for dusting things with flour or what have you, all for about $20. They had supplies for everything from cocktails to cake decorating to pizza making to sushi. Since it's aimed at commercial operations, everything seems durable and no frills, just what you need. Not going to buy kitchen stuff anywhere else from now on!”
- “I wanted to write specifically about my experience. I left a message for Paul & he called me back very promptly. He listened carefully and answered all questions, adding his expertise & gave me a number of suggestions. Unfortunately, through no fault of his, we weren't able to get the repair we needed, but I wanted to make sure that everyone knows what a great experience this was & just how much we appreciated his help.

- “I will not return here.  They on the surface are friendly and customer oriented but in reality are very suspect in their business practice.  It says returns are allowed within thirty days no questions asked and in truth they charge you even if the product is of poor quality.”
- “The stuff here needs big time improvement. The staff doesn't show any acknowledgement for any customers. I come here to get supplies for my restaurant. When I need help finding a item I always see the staff chatting and I see them looking at me they know I need help they just look at you and ignore you and keep talking. I find it very unprofessional Just unreal.”
- “The store has it's hours posted "open until 5 on Saturdays." I arrived at 4:50 and the doors were already locked. We knocked and waited for someone to acknowledge us. A lady was walking around the store, stopped to see us, and then proceeded to walk away and off the sales floor. There were other cars in the parking lot and other customers shopping. She clearly made the decision she would rather not help us just so she could try and close early. Well you just lost a customer for life. In an effort to support local businesses, they ended up snubbing me. Taking my business online. Unfortunate their sign "Open to the Public" doesn't include "Rude to customers" because that's what they truly are.”

## Tips from customers
Lots and lots commercial cleaning and restaurant equipment 
Kinda dusty inside

The homey, inviting environment of the restaurant along with the various choices left me smiling and loving Tucson already. The staff were so friendly and attentive, it almost felt like we were all family. I felt cared and loved for. I would come back again for sure, 200%. Perhaps, before I leave back for home :)”
- “Good spot for post trail runs in Catalina!  Always will recommend local breakfast stops!”

- “If I could I'd leave zero stars. My husband and I ate breakfast here a few days ago and were thoroughly disappointed. The wait time to get our food was outrageously long considering it wasn't that busy. When we got our food it was mediocre at best. I used the lady's room at one point and was disgusted to find feces droplets on the floor in several areas of the restroom. I informed our waitress that someone apparently had an accident in the bathroom and she just said oh my, and walked away- I never saw anyone go in to clean it. This experience ruined our breakfast and our impression of the cafe. We won't be returning.”
- “Totally disgusting breakfast and will never, ever return to that dumpy place. Once upon a time this place was okay but through the years it has completely declined. The omelet I ordered was more like a watered down, malnourished cheap crepe.  The hash browns were frozen with an attempt to fry them to warm up for serving. All of this for a price that was not worth even 25¢.  This place needs to close down or start over!!”
- “Horrible service, I ordered a side of hash browns and never got them. The French toast had no flavor, coffee wasn't fresh, the waitress we had was distracted easily and did not put the order in correctly. I commented to the manager that I was disappointed and he just shrug his shoulders. If you are in Catalina don't eat here. Claire's Cafe is much better. You pay a little more there but the food and service do not disappoint like this place.”

## Tips from customers
Goood food nice and clean as well Don't believe the one "$". It really is "$$"!! Meh Nothing special. This place is better than Claire's and Jerry Bobs food. Always perfect Great as always Try the pies!!!!  Just had peach and it is made with fresh peaches!  Delish! Always the best. Good atmosphere great food good price Great food, great service, nice atmosphere, good people! This place is wonderful.  Try the fluffy pancakes. Save room for pie! They have a great selection and they always taste great! Breakfast in Tucson. Yea for gravy! A Catalina landmark! Down home style cooking.
Always good, Always fun.

- “What a yummy dinner. This is my second time here and really enjoyed my meal yet again. I had the number 62, Pad Kee Mao w/ Beef with heat level Thai spice . Perfect amount of heat. Service was a tad inattentive, but they were busy and like almost everywhere, I'm sure they are understaffed so I completely understand. Me and my dining partner got there at 5 and it wasn't busy at all but by 5:30 they started filling up. I'm not sure why there are complaints on here about price. Sure, it may seem somewhat expensive initially, but the portions are large. I have leftovers.”
- “I got the shrimp pad Thai and it was so full of shrimp I couldn't believe it. Very delicious meal. Nice atmosphere, good staff.”

- “Ordered the Pad Thai, vegan with extra vegetables and received almost no vegetables and the tiniest little shreds of tofu you've ever seen.  It was basically noodles and sauce.  My Pad Thai at home is 1000x better and doesn't take that long to make, so I basically saved nothing by going here and got worse food.  Yay.”
- “What a disaster!  Placed a takeout order by phone. Was told it would be ready in 45 minutes. Arrived at the appointed time (7:10 pm) only to find others waiting for their orders. One man has been waiting ONE HOUR!  They also make you pay for your order before it comes out, which is unusual. But I did and put a healthy tip on my credit card. I then proceeded to wait another 45 minutes beyond the quoted pick up time until my order was delivered!  TOTALLY RIDICULOUS AND UNACCEPTABLE!    This location may be fairly new, but their Tucson location has been in business for years and doesn't have these problems. The servers lied to me more than once saying mine was "coming up".   I expect the truth when I call in an order. They need to tell customers that their order will be ready in an hour & a half, then it is MY decision to decide if I want to wait that long. They lied to every person who was waiting for their take out order. There were 6 of us who waited 45 minutes or longer after the promised time. It feels like a money grab by unscrupulous owners and staff.   Will I return?  NEVER!  They lost a customer and you can bet that I will tell all of my friends and neighbors about how bad and deceitful this restaurant is. Good luck staying in business. Customers don't want to be treated like dirt and waste hours to receive a meal.”
- “If you have any respect for yourself and your hard earned money you will not spend a dime here. I have been a customer for awhile now. Know how it works and pretty good food. Service is slow due to a lot of commotion and confusion. The servers run around like chickens with their heads cut off and they love to insult you. They will smile in your face and say all these kind words but when your back is turned they are insulting you and talking shit behind your back. Today was the final straw for me. I came in for lunch and started to order. I ask for a garlic chicken plate thinking since they serve a garlic chicken lunch they must have garlic chicken plate as they do with their other lunches such as holy chicken. They have a holy chicken lunch and they have a holy chicken plate. When I ask this she looked at me and said no lunch today. Just main courses. I said I understand that but you have a garlic chicken lunch do you make a garlic chicken main. This miscommunication went on for a couple minutes. Clearly she didn't understand the words that were coming out of my mouth. So I finished the order. I watched her go directly to another table and start talking shit about me to these complete strangers. I directly heard what she was saying and than this Karen joins right in with the insults, oh of course everyone knows restaurants don't serve lunch specials on weekends. In a sarcastic voice. I was just beside myself. They will welcome you in and smile in your face, take your money, say come back, than completely insult you when your gone. I have never seen such a thing in my life.”

- “Target is my go-to place for all things household related.  It's clean and bright. The aisles are wide.  The selection is great.  It has a Starbucks so I can indulge in a little coffee goodness while shopping.  Yes, it is a chain, but the staff is what makes this location so awesome.  Always friendly, always helpful.  I don't think I've ever been in here that I haven't been asked at least once during my visit if I'm finding everything okay (and I don't generally walk around looking confused) by some random staffer I pass in one of the aisles.”
- “The first thing that came to my mind when I walked into this Target was "Am I in a Super Target?".   This place is that huge.  Not only is it huge, but it is clean, well stocked with product, and easy to navigate.   In addition to that, the customer service here is great and I never have a problem finding what I want or checking out within a reasonable time.   I wish I lived near this location, so I could shop here every week. Alas, I do not, as it is a 45 minute drive from where I live.”
- “What can I say?  I just love Target.  This is the closest one to our house, so we venture here quite often.  Usually at least twice a week.  Now that they have an expanded grocery section, we go even more.  They have all the staple items we need and more.  They also have all the household cleaners/items, hygiene products, and over-the-counter medications that we use, at great prices.  There are some departments where their selection isn't the best, like certain bathroom and kitchen items, but overall, they can often be our "one stop shop".  This particular Target is always clean.  The staff is always very friendly and helpful.  The store is laid out in a way that is easy enough for me to navigate.  My only gripe is that they sometimes don't have enough registers opened, but when the lines are getting out of hand, they are generally quick to remedy that.  In summary:  I love Target, even though they take more money from me than I ever plan on spending because I always find more items I need!  I don't mind, though.”

- “Seriously just one register open. I hate using self checkout and even then the line for self checkout is way too long. Get more registers open. I know everyone's frantic with everything going on in the world but for people that need to get in and out and back to work this is unacceptable.”
- “We used our target red card for the first time in a year or so after getting a use or loose notification in the mail. Charged about $60. First bill we get has a $28 late fee attached to it. Thanks Target for everything. This is the second time this occurred. Last time was why we quit using it. The card is now cut in pieces. We have others too use but now I will avoid your stores too like Covid19.”
- “Awful service and policies. Staff keeps popular products hidden in back room well beyond street date to avoid selling to customers so employees can buy for themselves and resell.”

## Tips from customers
Very clean, organized store.  Plenty of cashiers. Agh, argh..... I like the overall Ambience with direction for employees to keep clean like this. Containers for moving, cardboard boxes are so yesterday... Now that they added groceries, there's less of other things. :( Late night .... No lines I love target Grocery section is now open. Has clean reztrooms!! Download the mobile cartwheel app and make use of the Barcode scanner to check your items for sales. Today was 40% off all Halloween costumes. Also check the end caps that's where all the clearance is. You're welcome! Love love love Love the new electronics area! Pro Tip:  Buy Hemorrhoid Suppositories, Urine Catheters, and a Wart Removal Kit, and then ask for a Gift Receipt. toys r' us for mommies!!   :) Super Target has arrived! Target is like my home I love it so so much Lots of birthday cards. suck it hallmark. Your place for pretty much anything. Like the plastic carts, not as hot after sitting in the sun.. Love this target!! The pharmacy is open 7 days but is closed from 1:30 to 2:00 daily.

I normally go in with an idea and I let her do her "thing" and I'm also so impressed with what she comes up with! Not only do they look amazing, but they are delicious as well!! She is my "go-to" gal, and if you give her a try she'll be yours too!!! You won't be disappointed!”
- “This is the ONLY place I buy fresh meat and seafood. The store is clean and the employees are friendly. They are always ready to answer any questions you may have. The store is easy to navigate. The deli is always stocked meat and cheeses. If Albertsons doesn't sell something you want, you can fill out a request card for it and they will get it in for you. Excellent customer service!”
- “I wish wish wish your employees would take over the Albertsons that is actually near my house. I've had so many terrible experiences at the one on Silverbell and Speedway that I will be shopping at Safeway from now on, but every time I've been to your store the employees in the Meat/Seafood department have been SUCH a pleasure. They've made my day on more than one occasion. If anybody from management is reading this, please give them a pat on the back for a job well done! There smiles and friendly attitudes have gone a long way!”

- “The staff is amazing.  The produce is just ok, and it's expensive.  The real reason for the one star review is this- after nine years of loyalty, I made a seemingly iniquous purchase- an unopened $30 tooth brush head.  I left in a hurry and didn't get a receipt.  Obviously- after 9 years as a loyal customer I'm not bashing them for 1 bad interaction- but this is the straw that broke the camel's back after years of them changing management and internal policies.   The brush head turned out to be the wrong one.  Even though Sonicare has confirmed that they accept the return without question (since I'm just exchanging it from another equally priced model) the manager on duty wouldn't accept it.  Based on that, it feels like laziness is overtaking customer service, so for that- I'm out.   The annoying thing is that I'm there weekly for the last nine years.  I spend between $5K-$12K there a year, and chose to shop there exclusively.  If loyalty doesn't matter to them then they don't deserve it.  Plain and simple.  I'm now going to send the return to sonicare myself, getting my money back and taking my (and my family's) business elsewhere.  MY Albertsons family is now a Fry's family.”
- “Very poor customer service with upper management and cashier. Please be careful when using the just 4  you app although my items were selected on the App and on "my list" the prices were still not honored. Over 26$ was added to my bill- Go the extra mile and shop at Safeway at least there they help resolve the problem instead of making it worse.”

## Tips from customers
It does look yummy for only 1.49! I could feel its warm! By the way the cashier was friendly when I checked out :-)

- “We used this company a few weeks ago for our front and back yard that have a couple of bushes and a large tree. Not to mention our back yard was covered in weeds from all the rain! They did an amazing job and got everything cleaned up and cleared out! They were easy to communicate with, schedule and very affordable! We have paid double in the past with other companies and they didn't do half as much as this company! We are so pleased that we have requested monthly service with them! We would definitely recommend Anthony to anyone! Thank you!”
- “Anthony and his wife came by to give me an estimate for giving our Palo Verde tree a serious trimming, blow our front yard gravel and get rid of a problematic vine in the back.  He had it scheduled for the same weekend.  He and his partner did a great job, and the cleanup was immaculate and the price was extremely reasonable especially for all the work they did.  I have him already scheduled him for January to trim back our bushes for the winter.    Anthony's wife, Ariana cleans houses.  If her work is as good as his work is, I'll be using her in December as I recuperate from surgery in December.  I definitely recommend them for landscaping AND house cleaning. His phone number is: 520-539-9774”
- “We have two different yards. Low maintenance rock/gravel with 3 trees in front and what passes for grass in the back with a lemon tree. The alley also has three large mesquite trees on our property line. We started using Entrust Landscaping a little over a year ago. Both yards and the alley were amazing when they finished.  Their attention to detail, work ethic, and personalities were really top notch. They maintain communication with us at all times and inform us of any possible delays or schedule changes. Since then, they have been performing monthly maintenance for us and we could not be happier. We highly recommend Entrust if you are looking for excellent landscaping or yard work.”

- “BEWARE!!!  DON'T USE HIM!!!  He will tell you he can do all this work and then not show up. Took him 3 weeks and he still hasn't finished what he said he was going to do.  My fault for feeling bad for him because his truck was demolished and thought helping him out was a nice thing and paying him. Here are some pics of how he left our backyard! All he says is money in hand job complete.  People on Yelp please take notice and DON'T use him. Thank you for nothing!!!”
- “do not!!!!!  i mean do not waste your time- this is the most dishonest, unprofessional and unreliable company we have ever dealt within our lives..... the owner quoted us for a job - not only was it not completed but we got excuse after excuse after excuse as to why-  we dealt with this total joke of a company for more than 3 weeks - nothing but excuse after excuse....they rescheduled more than 10 times and did not do the work they were paid to do.  we had to hire another company to do the job!  with all the other companies out there don't bother contacting them. if we could give negative stars we would. save yourself a lot of stress and heartache and keep searching....you will be glad you did!”
- “Unfortunately our experience was poor. First, he was late so I never got to talk to him regarding our wishes before he started. Then I arrived back to our home to pay him and only the back yard was done. He stated that's all he quoted us for. It seemed unusual but, Okay, no biggie let's move on and get the job finished... I asked him, "How much more for our small front yard?" He said another $100 and to trim the tree we specifically wanted him out for was going to be an additional $30. So the $100 quote came to $230 now! Okay, get the job done you're here, right?! Never trimmed the tree and promised to be back on multiple occasions and then said he would not charge us for maintenance the following month. We just wanted the work done that we paid him for. We are very reasonable and fair people. He never came back, we had to hire someone else. So in other words he doesn't finish his work and wants to be paid upfront for the work he's not going to do. Hope you have a better experience.”

He comped us some bubble wrap to make it right. He repacked it with no scolding and said now we know better. Well all I can say is we'll be back.I said this was the best shipping store I have been in and everyone behind me in line agreed. He was so pleasant that the other customers were not impatient and noticed what a nice guy to take time to help. A+ Kindness is back, no more it's not my job.  We ship often and just fired UPS for a very expensive lost package. Useless piece of shit=UPS trying to track a package is even harder than getting the package to the destination”
- “The Service at this store was exceptional  - employee Mike Wiley assisted me with reproducing some pictures at his store - sounds routine right? Not so - Mike lost his voice and couln't speak a word! He used one of those write and erase toys children use, to explain to me ALL of the steps to run the photo copier. A very long process but he did it so patiently. Now that's dedication! Atta Boy goes to Mike Wiley!!!!!!!!”

He was patient and detailed oriented; I appreciate that very much since I'm super OCD! ;) They did seem a little under staffed because there were people in and out non stop... but they seemed to manage it well.

- “Super slow!  After I waited over ten minutes they wouldn't take my return because the box condition. I used the original box that FedEx delivered. Seriously never step foot in that place again.”
- “I use to go here for everything.  The staff was always super fast and helpful. Last 2 times, normal staff was not there and the new guy running the show is one of the most unpersonable and difficult people.  Left feeling so uncomfortable both times.  His personality reminds me of the creepy uncle in a series of unfortunate events.”
- “I have yet to have a positive experience with FedEx. This was not it. I was out of the country visiting sick parents and my husband helped me drop off a package to be returned to the company I bought it from. I don't have loads of money, so I only buy things from places with stores in town I can return to, or free return shipping. My husband tells me they charged him $6+ for a new box because the box my item came in was too big. What? I come back home, email the company saying I had to pay cuz the box was too big (in case I was crazy and remembered wrong), company replies saying their shipping labels (from FedEx) account for box size and weight of my items and to contact FedEx for a refund because they can't refund me from FedEx. Makes sense. I go to FedEx livid because I got charged for something I should not have been charged for. I used the SAME box shipped to me by FedEx (which was NOT filled to the brim when it was shipped to me). So I tell them my husband was told the box was too big, please show me this new box he had to purchase to ship it in. Guy brings over the box, and it's not even smaller than the original box I had, it's BIGGER. After explaining the wrongful charge to Doug, he tells me that "FedEx Office" is some kind of fake FedEx or offshoot FedEx or whatever, with stricter packaging requirements than "normal FedEx". What??? Why is your fake storefront operating with stricter requirements than your main company? Also, I'm shipping back a wireless bra that won't incur damaged even if it gets smushed. I don't NEED stricter packaging. Can I even opt out of these "stricter requirements"? Who knows, but I'm awaiting my refund for this bogus charge after Doug talks to his manager. Want to make money? Start by shipping faster and better, not by charging your customers for extra, unnecessary packaging products. Tl;dr: If you have a prepaid label, save yourself money, time, and trouble, and go to a "normal/main FedEx" location UNLESS your box is undamaged and you've filled it to the brim with packing peanuts or bubble wrap or air packs. Even then, I can't guarantee they won't charge you for something like your tape isn't strong enough. If you don't, go somewhere else. FedEx is garbage. UPS or USPS are much better, and I've had no issues from either, but have constant and slow issues with FedEx.”

Know exactly what you need, some of the staff is undertrained on their capabilities.

The staff knows what there doing along with a attitude that they like working there. I 'm glad to drive past many practices to get there. Thanks”

- “The service at this clinic is horrendous. As a location that performs eye surgery that requires a driver to wait while patients are having surgery done - the clinic provides no comfort for patients or their family/driver. There is no wifi, barely enough seats for half of the patients, no restroom, no refreshments, and horribly uncomfortable seats. Although this may all seem trivial, it really speaks to the clinics bottom dollar and how they feel about the comfort of their patients. Furthermore, I found it incredibly unprofessional that the clinic dilates patient's eyes and then returns them to the general waiting room (where there are no seats) to wait uncomfortably with an eye patch. This place is horrible. When they tell you the time of your appointment - I recommend asking about their apparent +/- a few hours policy - as you will wake up early to spend at least an hour or two crammed in a small uncomfortable outdated waiting room with 15-20 other people.”
- “Would not recommend this place. They run patients through like cattle, and it takes forever to get in and get done. The people who check your eyes are young underlings who may or may not know what they're doing. Finally, you get to see a real doctor at the very end for a few minutes. When I got my glasses, one lens did not work properly. It was out focus. When I asked for some relief, I was told that they had given me the wrong prescription, but that it was MY fault, because I had probably answered the technicians' questions wrong when they did the tests. I'm 68 years old, and this has never happened anywhere, not even LensCrafters, but in this case they automatically assumed it had to be me. To add to the insult, they wanted to charge me $35 more for the doctor to recheck my eyes. I finally settled for them making the messed up lens the same prescription as my old glasses, which do kind of work. What lousy attitudes toward customers. What lousy service. And, they were upset that I had the gall to complain. As soon as I get my half-assed glasses back, which will take ANOTHER two weeks, I will never go back again. FYI--This company is building another clinic in Oro Valley to victimize even more people. Don't give them the chance!”
- “I went with my daughter to her appointment April 20. Upon entering I had no problem as we were sitting and waiting a worker comes out to me and states that there are no pets allowed. He did not ask if she was a service animal just assumed that she was just a pet. It was a good thing I had her vest with her. I was very disappointed that I did not get an apology. I would like to give anyone with a service animal a heads up about them.  They are not respectful at all and they only care about business. Thank goodness I did not make an appointment for myself.”

## Tips from customers
They seem very thorough. The wait was too long but the overall quality is very good Be prepared for a 1 1/2-2 hr wait. Actually 2 half stars Great care and advice on my sight. ThNks

- “I've had this bookmarked for years, wondering if I'd ever get the chance to go. Luckily I happened to be in Tucson on a Thursday, which is vegan night. I got almost everything at the buffet; it was all delicious. There was a group of people at a table near mine who were speaking Hindi the entire time. I could listen to that all day. I was in heaven. There is a little boutique where you can buy various Indian clothing, incense, etc. definitely one of my favorite places.”
- “Great buffet. They grow the ingredients there on the property. Love the patio. Thursday is vegan night and it's vegetarian the rest of the time. Love the homemade salad dressings and whatever awesome food they are making. delicious. Cool place to take kids too, they have a fish pond and birds, plus the large patio. it's great.”
- “Exceptional vegetarian food prepared with love. I love that their cutlery and plates are made from corn and you throw them in a compost bin when finished with your meal. How cool is that! Every bite was delicious. Best vegetarian meal I've ever had. My kids enjoyed the peacocks and other colorful birds and the peaceful koi pond. A wonderful place.”

- “Food was cold and dry. If your planning on coming here do not come on a weekday when it's slow. If you don't see a full parking lot, keep driving. Service was ok, but food ruined it.”
- “Food is ok. But not clean, was already disgusted when I saw fly flying on the food.. The only thing I find ok is the papadam and lentil soup.  The rest nahhhh.  Oh yah, save your $2 and don't get the samosa. Stuffing is ok, but the dough was dry...   In terms of politeness... Almost 0. First the samosa. If it is a buffet there should not be an extra charge on a dish that is on the buffet table.  After I took the samosa, then I saw extra $2.   The bald cashier guy told me to pay $2 or  put it back.  I was going to put it back, then I'm thinking sanitary.  So I paid him $2.  2nd impoliteness is rude towards specific people.   an elder gentleman started a conversation with me, which made him eat a lot slower. We were their til 8:45 (closing is 9) so we saw the servers rushing us out. The old man still has some food on his plate, he was thinking, don't want to throw them away, so he tried to pack them. ( it was not a lot of food left) but the bald cashier guy told him he was not allow to pack it home. Which triggers: "fine I am not coming back" and surprisingly or not the bald cashier guy said, "fine  don't come back".  I think these guys are rude to him coz he has been there few times.  And that guy can eat a lot of food.”
- “I planned to have lunch here today with a friend and I was really looking forward to it. After reading the reviews on here we decided to skip it because the caged birds would be too depressing. Sorry, Govinda's. Thanks yelpers.”

- “I would give them a 0 on the stars but can't leave a review if you don't mark a star.  Husband dropped a newly purchased suit still in the bag to get alterations on the pants only. But wanted the full suit dry cleaned after. He dropped off on a Friday the suit wouldn't be ready until the next Friday. I picked up the suit a week later. I got it home there is a very noticeable blue(suit is tan) pen mark on it. You can tell the dry cleaners knew about it because it had a stain remover stain around it. This was not pointed out to me when I picked it up. I go back Monday and explain. No apologies just pick it up after 5 p.m. tomorrow., I was told. Go to pick it up today and told I have to pick it up in alterations. Go into alterations and explain again what happened. She argued that the dry cleaners didn't do it they don't have pens. So finally after her saying that a few times she says if it was anyone it was alterations. I finally said I don't care who did it but it should've been brought to my attention and an apology should've been given. I'm sorry I've been using this location off & on for 15 years. I will never be back.”
- “Terrible terrible terrible charged me almost $70 dollars to tailor my work pants and they destroyed them. Had to go to AKs and she fixed everything. Shame on you Mendel's”

- “Great haircut, great barber, great prices. I will be going back again. It feels nice to finally have a place where I can be a regular. It's also enjoyable not going to a generic commercial place like super cuts.”
- “I'm so glad my daughter brought me here! The staff is fun and knowledgeable. Chloe was my stylist. She listened to what I wanted and delivered! She gave me great suggestions and advice for dealing with my super dry hair.   I will definitely see you again! Thank you so much for a great experience. I absolutely love my color!”
- “Went in for haircut on Saturday morning. I booked an appointment on their website. I got in there a little early and there was no wait which was awesome. I showed the woman a picture of the hairstyle I wanted. She was fairly knowledgeable about how we should go about getting it cut and styled. It wasn't the shortest or fastest haircut but it looks awesome. I cannot remember their names off the top of my head but the gentleman that was working as well helped her out as well. He came over and helped trim up some spots also used a straight edge for the back of my neck which is my most sought out request because I hate when the hair on the back of my neck grows out of control and hair salons aren't able to shave it gone or almost all the way gone. I was so impressed that had my wife take our son to get his haircut there on Sunday morning. His haircut was about 20 minutes not his first haircut but definitely looks good. Their goal is to try to get kids in and out in 10 minutes so they do a good job of cutting kids hair to a cool style in a short amount of time. They also gave him some pretty cool temporary tattoos that he won't stop asking to put on now. Will definitely come back.”

- “I would give Hair Garage/Lisa zero stars if I was able. I went there today because of the "great"reviews and was not only seriously out of money but, left with seriously bad hair! I am disappointed with how unprofessional Lisa was. She saw me @ 11:00am and I didn't get out of there til after 2:00pm. That's not the worse part...when I left,  my ash blonde highlights I requested were orange on the top and ash on the ends and burnt. I told her I didn't want orange or yellow highlights and you know what she said: Go across the street to Sally's Beauty Supply and buy a bluing shampoo but, don't get it on the ash highlighted ends of my hair when I shampooed because they would turn purple! WTF!!!!!!!  Not only did she charge me $75.00 for a f-ed up job I also had to go across the street and get "more" professional advice from the girls @ Sally's Beauty! They recommended Mercedes who works at the shop next door to them on 22nd/Kolb! DO NOT GO TO LISA @ Hair garage she has no idea what she's doing! Also, I sliced my foot open on the 2nd chair from the front that has a missing foot place and my foot was bleeding and cut....not to mention my burnt ear from the bleach.”
- “Look elsewhere. I'm new in town and was looking for a good Barber (I'm so sick of cheap haircuts!). Place seemed legit. However, the haircut was not Barber quality. Just seemed like another franchise cut. I was disappointed that my neck was not shaved (real barbers shave the neck with warm foam). And the deal breaker: the "barber" did not offer me anything to clean all the hair from my face when he was done! Sorry, but when I have to actually ask for a towel to wipe my own face after a haircut, I'm never coming back.”
- “Lisa used to trim my then longer hair until one day she decided to do what SHE wanted. First of all, she is always crabby, and is never cheerful. second of all, she chopped up my then one length hair. Never again!”

one word for lisa..edward scissor hands Going blonde thanks to Lisa! Getting my hair did Jeff seems to have most Sundays open & always has the football game on. Love this place!  Going blonder today Lexi did an awesome job on my hair! I will definitely be back. I love the comfortable feeling of this place. It's a diamond off the beaten path.

- “What a hoot!   03/09/2019 - A tiny bit on the seedy side, but everyone is down-to-earth friendly - especially the staff. This was basically the first time I've been there. (Okay, I was there over 40 years ago, but way too long ago to remember.)   We purchase clubhouse access and placed our bets in that area, but then crossed over to the general admission area to queue up with others outside to watch the race.  Very fun.”
- “Rillito Racetrack IS NOT CLOSED. I just went there today for a fine day of quarter horse racing. I loved photographing the races and this particular track deserves to be saved. The chute is on the National Register of Historic Places. Bob Baffert got his start here.   Today, we're close to ending the racing season for another year and guess who showed up to  celebrate the season? The Budweiser Clydesdales with their dalmatian buddy in the top seat of the wagon! What a sweet sight. They're here one more day and then they're off to Texas.  If you want to spend a fun day outdoors with the whole family AND show your support for preserving this historic property, come on out to the racetrack.  The races start at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday only.  This is another unique treasure Tucson must save from destruction.”

- “Horse racing is a cruel practice that should be banned. Thousands of Thoroughbreds are bred for racing every year.  Depending on the country, only 5% to 10% ever see a racecourse.  What happens to the others?  Unless they are lucky enough to find another career, they are disposed of, typically at a slaughterhouse and turned into pet food.  One of every 500 Thoroughbred starts at North American racetracks results in a fatal injury.  This represents about 800 deaths. Many racehorses become addicted to drugs when their trainers and veterinarians give them drugs to keep them on the track when they shouldn't be racing.”

## Tips from customers
Celtic festival What a great bike ride! Great way to spend a beautiful weekend afternoon with friends. Volunteering at the diabetes walk with the Junior League :) The best farmers market! Celtic Fest and Highland Games! Last day a rewarding. Great place to people watch. They have a gigantic area indoors that is out of the sun, cool and free to sit.  Views of mountains are amazing. Avoid the Bud Light because it tastes like azz! Taco Festival was fun! Lucha Libre was entertaining! Food is sorta crappy... Eat before you come. No credit cards, cash only. They have alcohol.

- “After having a horrible experience with a different Audi dealership in north Scottsdale, I was amazed at the impeccable professionalism and customer service Audi of Tucson provided. My sales associate, Eddie Zglinicki, was professional and extremely knowledgeable with respect to the Audi brand, and took the time to go over the features of the 2019 Audi A4 I purchased. Tim McElvain with the finance department was professional and not high-pressuring as you often encounter with a finance department. I was also surprised to find Audi of Tucson had the largest inventory of certified Audis, as well as very fair prices. It was well-worth the drive to down Tucson from Phoenix. Highly recommend buying from this dealership. Thanks guys for making my buying experience with you, relatively painless!”
- “Great service. My rental car for the time period of the software update was parked out front waiting for me. When I returned my car was finished & complete with a new car wash like brand spanking new. Inside of my car was lined with plastic and paper to keep it clean when workers were in there.”
- “Very well pleased wit Audi of Tucson, Dan Paris gave great advice, and timely service. Nice lobby to wait, doesn't get any better than this. Will be back.”

These people do not care about customer service BEWARE OF GERMAN and his SHADY business tactics GERMAN would most likely rip off his own family member and be ok with himself as long as he saw a profit. these people will find every possible way to screw you over. BEWARE OF GERMAN”
- “I took my Audi A8 to this dealership for service after my MMI screen failed. I have to say I was disappointed and felt that there is some dishonesty occurring in their service department. I have the Audi care select package and they failed to realize this. They told me I have to replace the arm bushings and tork rod and it is no longer under warranty but I complained about this issue when my car was under warranty and at the time they said this was a common problem and they did not require replacement!!  Seriously, Audi, you need to start paying attention to the service departments at your dealerships!!  Very unfortunate.”
- “Wow. I don't even know where to begin. Impressed with the certified pre-owned vehicle itself; the exact opposite of impressed with sales staff.  Dear Audi of Tucson,  We know that you've been working very hard to be noticed as a luxury car brand, especially with a newer generation of driver. I've noted your product placement in movies with amazing car chases for over ten years. We get it. We drove it, and we believe. Love the car. Can't think of anything we didn't like about it.  So why are we not buying it? Because of the extremely fungible and slippery (nonexistent?) price from literally one day to the next, the BS "We'd be taking a loss" line, the "Yesterday someone put a deposit on it, but we'd still sell it to you." Do you think since yesterday, when you refused to even discuss anything over the sticker price, that I came in today to engage in a fake bidding war to pay MORE for the vehicle? No. We came in with the 2014 Mercedes we looked at yesterday that the extremely motivated Mercedes salesperson insisted we test out for 24 hours, which, contrary to your assertion that they're "apples and oranges," is a direct class competitor, at a lower price. Also, even though I know you're probably making up the "someone has a deposit on it" story, do you think we'd be impressed that you'd sell a car from under someone who, in good faith, placed a deposit? In everything you said and did, we felt like you completely lacked integrity and even a modicum of style. There's another review on here explaining a negative sales experience, and ours was extremely similar.   Also, you never. ever. ever. ignore the girlfriend. Never. You don't pretend to not hear her questions, Robb, and The Girlfriend doesn't like having to ask twice.   Also, when you have a young professional in your sales office looking for their first "luxury" car, maybe you want to create a lifetime of loyalty to your brand. You can probably infer that their salary is only going up with time, and that there will be more expensive auto purchases in their future.   Regards,  The Girlfriend (who, by the way, was also in the market to buy a CPO Audi before the year's end)  P.S. Sorry we never got to meet you, Service dept. Apparently everyone loves you. Maybe you can train Sales?”

yikes! lol Looks small in the front but it's a very large operation! Very classy and friendly! Parts, parts, and more parts. Great job as always in the service department.

- “I had a slight emergency called at 7:30 am on a Saturday and they were able to take our pup in at 12:30 same day. Needed to get sutures and sedated for a cut. What I appreciated was they told me appx what the cost would be when I called.( which others would t even dare give me a estimate) as well my regular vet was not open on a Saturday . I truly appreciate the awesome service and great customer service. As well didn't mind having to pay what I thought was reasonable pricing for the great same day service. Keep up the great work!”
- “This place should be called "Love Mountain Vet" because of both the way they treat the pets (and the pet parents), and the way I feel about the clinic!  Right off the bat, from the first phone call I made to schedule an appointment, I knew I was in good hands.  The gentleman I spoke with to make the appointment really listened well, was very friendly and helpful, and managed to get me in more quickly than other vets, for an issue that had some urgency (to me) with one of our dogs.  So I was pleased just to be able to get in to see a veterinarian so quickly.  Then, when I had the appointment itself, it went really well.  They really have this process down in terms of keeping clients and pets COVID-safe and handling the appointments.  The MINUTE I drove up, a staff member came out to greet me (I didn't even have to call), provided me with some new client paperwork, briefly discussed the issue our dog is having, and gave me next steps.  Very friendly and professionally, I might add.Then, in just the right amount of time, someone came back out to the car to get that paperwork and took our dog in to be seen.  Dr. Horton called me to consult about her findings, and she was pleasant, thorough, and informative.  I really enjoyed working with her.  They bandaged up our dog's foot, prescribed medication, and off I went.  Our dog is doing well.  Not only that, but I asked them to do a nail trim on our dog while she was there being seen, and they didn't balk, and they did the best job on her nails that I've ever seen.  I've been to day care groomers, boarding groomers, other vet groomers, and nobody has been able to trim her very difficult nails as well as they did at Dove Mountain.  The staff here seem consistently excellent.  Granted, because of COVID, I didn't actually enter the facility, but I did interact with a couple of vet techs, and with the veterinarian herself (Dr. Horton, with whom I was extremely impressed).  In addition, I observed other vet techs and staff members assisting other clients, and every one of them seemed friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and just on the ball.  I know that was true for me.  We've got several dogs and cats and over the years we've seen quite a few veterinarians, and I have to say this may be the most impressive clinic I've been to.  You can just tell that these are caring, compassionate people who absolutely excel at customer service as well.  Somebody is doing something right here, because even with the best veterinary clinics, you almost always have some dissatisfied clients.  But before coming here, I read reviews very thoroughly and they consistently praised Dove Mountain Vet and I see for myself why.  I'm a fan.  I plan to return with our other pets.”

- “we waited more than 8 hours outside to see an emergency vet in the middle of a snowy time ... they kept telling user were next ... after 8 hours we were told it could be at least 7 more hours ! we left without our dog being seen we went to our regular vet the next day ... I would never think of going there again in an emergency or not ! so rude as we were not even allowed to go in to use the bathroom !”
- “I took Pegasus here because he was having trouble breathing.  I was not sure if his vaccinations were up to date and I made this clear to the staff when I booked his appointment.  They thought that he needed a couple shots to help out his breathing.  They never once expressed any concern about not having all of his medical history prior to the shots and never went over the possible risks with me.  Well, as it turns out Pegasus bit two people while he was getting his shots.  Obviously!  He is a cat!  The staff called animal control and now a sheriff will be at my house tomorrow to take him into quarantine for TEN DAYS.  Had I known this was even a thing I would have never allowed them to give him shots.  Congrats on getting Pegasus off the streets.  GREAT WORK!  Tucson can sleep a little easier tonight thanks to you.”
- “This was a very poorly run facility by the staff. Essentially everyone I interacted with came off as very rude and the treatment of my dog was poor. I had my little baby groomed and she came back looking horrible! Avoid this place at all costs.”

Today I got the Lavender Oat milk latte and the caprese panini. The panini was SO delicious and I savored every bite. Their coffee is rich and delicious and full of flavor. I highly recommend trying Ren out next time you are wanting a great cup of coffee.”
- “Great place for coffee and pastries - we've stopped in twice during morning walks on the Rillito and have left very content and caffeinated. It is a little pricey, but you can definitely taste the quality in their food and coffee. For food, we've only tried the pastries (they offer a good assortment to choose from), and our favorite would be the berry scones - they were warm and tasted freshly baked with delicious whole blueberries. We've had both their hot and iced coffees; the cafe miel with its honey, cinnamon, and nutmeg goodness was lovely and felt like a treat - if you're looking for a non-dairy alternative, I recommend it with oatmilk!   In terms of COVID safety, I appreciate their system of ordering with one way traffic (enter through one door, exit through a different on the opposite side of the coffeehouse and a hand sanitizer dispense).”
- “Great selection of treats, smoothies, bowls and toasts plus all the usual coffee and tea drinks. The decaf coffee had a slight earthiness yet was very smooth. They offer watermelon and cucumber water or regular water as help yourself drinks. The pastries are a mix of delicious looking muffins and scones plus a whole row of vegan and gluten-free energy bars plus some huge gluten-free peanut butter cookies. I had a raw vegan energy bar made with almond butter, chia, oats and topped with chocolate drizzle. All of the energy bar ingredients were listed on the display case, making it easy for people with food allergies.”

- “went in this morning, as a friend of mine wanted to check it out.  i ordered a strawberry lemonade smoothie that cost about 7.50.  i was a bit taken aback by the price when compared to the size and the ingredients.  as i watched the young man make it i noticed they used concentrates as opposed to real fruit.  i was way disappointed in that, but reminded myself the owner swooped in from out of state and opened a business.  maybe she does not understand the importance of quality ingredients. what really bothered me even more than a fruit smoothie made with concentrates was the reliance upon plastic!!!!!  i noticed that even for those who chose to dine in that plastic was the option, not reusable.  i then looked around for a recycling bin to alleviate the burden of all that plastic and to my disappointment, i did not see one.  guess the owner doesn't know or care about the damage the single use plastics do to the environment.  should have gone with my gut instinct when i first saw it had opened to never enter and support the business.  now i know why.”
- “My family and I had come in for coffee . They were very rude , bad customer service . No courtesy at all.  Would not come again. The girl behind the counter was who served us the coffee watched s the whole time we stayed .”
- “This was my first time coming to this coffee shop. I was excited to try it as it had amazing reviews. As soon as I stepped into the coffee shop I was yelled at and treated very rudely. I watched one more customer be treated very rudely told to "step out that the line was outside." As I stood in line I watched both counters, on one side it was Scottie who treated his customers very nicely and on the other counter it was Alex (the one who had yelled at me and didn't provide the best first impression). I was hoping that I was helped by Scottie and I did, if it wasn't for him I would not come back. Please thank him, he has an amazing personality. My rating is so low because of how rude I was treated, it makes it hard to enjoy everything else when that's how you get treated.”

## Tips from customers
They have coffee smoothies so be sure to ask about it! The zipline I am a true lover of the classic latte. Whole milk, no fancy flavors. I drink a LOT of them, all over town. Ren wins ~ BEST latte in Tucson. Pay with cash to get a 4% discount. Fat Americano is more than a tasty coffee. It's a traditional Americano blended with coconut oil! Served hot and delicious!!! They close the kitchens an hour before closing time though you can still buy drinks. Very delicious lattes

- “Much better than the Mann location.”
- “BOTTOM LINE: knowledgeable and friendly staff, well stocked supplies, excellent overall experience.   I would highly recommend them and definitely use them again.  Full review:  A few months ago my wife and I finally got down to business and drew out plans to landscape our massive mud pit. I mean yard.  This was badly needed for the past 7 years ESPECIALLY with our growing family (4 kids, dog, cat, etc.) let alone the fact that every monsoon season our yard turned into a swamp.  We are not rich by any American standards of the word so it meant that we were going to be doing virtually all the work ourselves, too.  Before doing anything we brought our drawing to Georgia (huge props to her) who became a key player in helping us plan, giving us a multitude of money-saving tips and explaining the pros and cons between the different materials they could provide us. David and Luis all worked closely with us with whatever we needed as well.  So after the initial planning, the work began...  We trenched out and laid about 200 linear feet of irrigation, planted 26 different trees and shrubs (thank you Magic Garden!) which means I shoveled 26 holes by hand, and had over 30 tons of decomposed granite, decorative rock, soil and sand dumped in my yard (more shoveling).  We put down a 315 sq ft plot of artificial grass and put in a couple hundred feet of edging and railroad ties to make borders across the yard.  We laid tree wells and put patio stones down.  We also built an Olympic-sized sandbox for the kids out of the ties and put down rubber mulch for the playground.  Did I mention that we did this ourselves? My hat goes off to everyone who does this stuff for a living.  I lost over 20 pounds while doing this project.     So here we are 3 months later and we finally have something that looks like a yard.  I don't know what to do with my time anymore so I'm writing this review.    We couldn't have done it without the support and help from reputable companies like Pioneer. Thank you!”

- “Horrible business. I asked for 1/4 ton of soil, they put in a little over 1/2 ton and charged me for it. They have you weigh your vehicle, then load it, then weigh again. Most businesses load you while you are on the scale.   When I told the lady I only asked for 1/4 ton, she said I could go shovel it out if I want. Wow. And they are cash only. Poor customer service.”

- “In late August, we had David and Robert come to look at our leaking refrigerator - a fantastic refrigerator that we did not want to replace - and they did so. They were a little delayed (understandable, in that they cannot know just how long a job will take - not a big deal), but they came equipped to work and finished the job in a timely fashion. Cost was very reasonable. Our refrigerator has been working well since. Job well done! Thank you!”
- “David and his father came out to my home last week to fix my washer and dryer they were fast,  already had the parts with them ,already knew exactly what the issues were , I recommend the service they really reliable they came the same day didn't give me any headache:)”
- “My dishwasher broke and called a few different places. 7 Days Appliance Repair responded very quickly and was out the next day. Unfortunately he was not able to repair the dishwasher because the internal board went out, he did show me the tests he went through to rule out any other problem. They were very thorough and checked out the whole machine. If anything else happens to an appliance in the future they will be my first call. Very reasonable rates as well.”

- “If I could provide 0 stars, I would. I had messaged via Yelp with the owner about a quote for my Samsung fridge--I was very clear about my appliance in need of support.  Set up a scheduled window via messaging that they were to show up within.  Then they never showed up during the window.  When I called, a technician answered and said that I wasn't on the schedule.  I was attempting to reschedule and then the technician informed me that they don't even service my appliance.  So the entire week that I waited for them to come check out my fridge was a complete waste--you would think that the owner would have known they couldn't service my machine or how to put my appointment on the books if they could.  Overall, I won't be lured in again by the promise of an inexpensive quote if they won't even show up to offer it.”
- “DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! THEY ARE CROOKS AND ROBBERS! I called for my dishwasher not working. A tech came out and checked and said it needed a part. He went for the part and returned and installed it. I paid him with my card, $287, on Nov. 9th. Worked great for a few days and then stopped just like before, nothing. I called the tech and he said he would be out but never showed up or called. I texted, called, emailed, Nothing. I asked for my money back. Lazar called after almost six weeks, only after my wife posted a bad review, and said he would return my money the next day.  I called the next day and he said no, as it was the tech who got the money.  I DON'T CARE WHO GOT MY MONEY, THEY SCREWED ME BIG TIME. I can't believe a local company, or any company, would do that. BEWARE of them at all costs. Lazar: If you resolve this like a real company would, I will remove this Post.  David M.”
- “called them to setup appointment and person on phone really rude after got confirmation number no one showed up and not even a phone call after i called them they  were even worse stating its not their responsibility to contact customer if out of service area so why did you confirm my appointment in first place crazy they need find something that they love doing lol  thanks”

- “I have been taking both my dogs here since I moved to Tucson.  They are always polite and courteous.  I had a scheduling mix-up one time and I was annoyed but was beyond appreciative that they made it right.  I can't say my dogs love going but they do look lovely when they are done.”

- “Worst Place ever.This is the only place I have ever reviewed. Our dog got Kennel Cough from this nasty place and the owner wanted none of that information. 2 weeks to the day after we had our little lap dog groomed there she came down with a horrible cough.We took her to an emergency vet at 1 am in the morning and 400 dollars later she was diagnosed with kennel cough.  We are very protective of her and do not take her to dog parks or boarding facilities so we know where she got it. They groom dogs from Pima Animal shelter there and our vet said that they treat many dogs with kennel cough from there. I know you think I am trashing these people but go ahead and try them but make sure if your dog gets sick to put a review out to protect other dogs and their owners.”
- “Super sad! My dog is 5 months old and had his first groom. The day before he had a series of shots done and was super sensitive to touch on his back. When my son dropped him off he informed them that he was sore and to be aware of it when cleaning him. After three hours my errands were done so I called them and the lady on the phone said he was a "pistol" and had given them trouble. I could here my poor dog crying in the back, I explained once again it aaa from his shots, she disagreed and brushed me off. I bath him every week and he is fine! He actually loves water and people and has NEVER whined or cried like he did with his shots and when his back was touched or like he did when she was on the phone with me. I sent my son to get him because I was crying and upset with how it all went down and hearing him and didn't think I could handle confronting her. My son stated she once again argued with him and that we were "lucky" we didn't get charged more for a difficultly fee. This please had no compassion for my sweet dog who had shots and they clearly should have contacted me when he seemed inconsolable and whined! He weights 5 lbs and she stated he was aggressive, which he NEVER had been before but I guess when you HURT him he might be. Be aware people! Plus he looks ridiculous!”
- “Very disappointed today. After being called on the phone and told our girl would be ready in 20 minutes, we arrived to find out they had not yet started on her. The girl denied ever calling us..wow!  We told her we would just take her back home and be done at this point. A few minutes later another young lady came outside to charge us for the bath and nail clip. We told her that Lexi said she had not even started on her yet. Long story short we left and returned 30 mins later to pick up our dog. Eyebrows uneven, beard uneven, a whole patch on her back totally missed and just not the quality care we paid for. Needless to say we won't be back.”

## Tips from customers
This is Belle's new place she's been my long time groomer for my dog Sully and she's always done a wonderful job.  A++++ Love how they are so attentive and professional! They have a Facebook page where they post pictures of your dog's final look! Sully loves the all natural low calorie pumpkin treats, 20% off yelp coupon! Locally owned small business.   They do great work and show genuine care for the client and their pets. They do a great job and really take care of the dogs. Been going here for seven years, never a problem and my dog loves them. Our dogs know best Make sure to clarify any of your rewards you try to redeem. I had a free Spaw Treatment and was charged for a Spaw Treatment instead. While the staff does a fantastic job of grooming and taking care of your dog, I had a terrible experience in trying to use the rewards program for the first time.

- “Wow, this was by far the best massage I've had in a while! The venue is clean and serene, and a 60 minute massage is $60, and there's $5 off with a Yelp check-in. Everyone wears face masks inside, so I felt very safe.   I told the masseuse that I had a lot of knots and stiffness in the neck/trap area, and she focused a great deal on these areas, and also performed the full body massage. There's also hot stones that were used during the massage, and I was completely on cloud-nine! By the end of the 60 minutes, I was super relaxed, and you're given a bottle of cold water when you check out. Definitely recommend coming here!”
- “We were running late and called to ask if we can come in at 9:30pm and they waited for us!  We got a couple combo massage and they were very nice and polite.  The foot massage in the communal area but for the back massage you go into a private room.  Massages were satisfying and relaxing!”

- “Unfortunately, this was not a good experience for me.  Called this morning and made an appointment then when I arrived neither of the staff spoke English and did not know about my appointment.  They called a lady who spoke English and she was the one who took my call but apparently didn't tell them or the price she had quoted me.  Went ahead and got 30 minute neck and shoulder massage, but he kept trying to do full body.  I was unable to explain where my pain was or ask him questions because he didn't seem to understand one word of English.  He focused on one side of my body only and I had to keep pointing to the other side.  Would not go back or recommend this place. This place is in Tucson, Arizona.  Don't know why it says I am from San Francisco.”

It's ok... Awesome stop for a massage! Best place in this area. Don't go anywhere else.

I took the keys home and I just moved to a new house and I didn't have anyone to drive me over there so the driver from Bronco came over to my house and picked up my keys. He was here within about 15 to 20 minutes....Much earlier than I expected him which was great! They towed my car to my mechanic. I had excellent communication with the dispatcher and the driver was super professional and nice. I would definitely recommend this company!”
- “Bronco towing came all the way up to Rose Canyon Lake to bring our car to Tucson for repair.  Our driver was Randy.  He was polite, quick, professional, and very helpful.  We had to change repair shops mid-tow and he handled it with courtesy.  Randy made our stressful day much easier to handle!  Highly recommend!”

- “I had a flat tire and  my roadside assistance is through geico.  They called bronco towing to come fix my flat tire. I was told by geico that their contract states that the company would respond within an hour. After an hour had passed and no Bronco towing.  I called Bronco and was told that the truck had other calls ahead of me.  When I mentioned that geico told me 1 hour, he said we try to respond in one hour but no guarantee.  Called geico, they called Bronco and were told that someone would be there in 15-20 minutes.  20 minutes later still waiting, called geico, who called Bronco and they said they would be there in 15 minutes. I told them not to bother. By the time I got off the phone, it had been almost 2 hours.  Why say you'll be there in an hour, or 15 minutes if you're not going to show up.  Totally disgusted, will make sure if I ever need roadside assistance that Bronco Towing is not called.”
- “This was one of my worst experiences with a auto repair shop.  I went in with failed emissions. The scanned all parameters and sensors, found several active codes, inspected fuel rail pressure sensor connector was loose on sensor, cleaned pins and re-secured sensor then road test for 85 miles took to emissions and passed.  $367.50 in labor $20 in parts and $2 hazmat fee.  391.24 DMV says repairs cannot be more than 300.  I got robbed and on top of it.  When I picked up the car Albert said, "your car is fast".  WTF who says that to a customer.  I will not be going back”

## Tips from customers

- “We have been looking for a small Lance camping trailer for some time. I noticed one listed on craigslist for Eastside RV Liquidators. They had just gotten it in. I called and told them I was 1.5 hours away and on my way. Before I arrived, they had numerous calls and one person tried to put down deposit on the Lance. They were told to wait until after I saw the camper since I called first. So glad they did!  The camper was in excellent condition with a price far less than we expected. Also, the service people were friendly and helpful when we returned for the camper. This place is great.  When we returned to Las Cruces, we told our neighbors about the dealership. They called and asked to be notified if something similar to ours showed up. The next week they returned with a camper exactly like they were looking for.”
- “Outstanding service and SUPPORT! Mark and April are honest and knowledgeable and we were very comfortable working with them. We were in need of a quick sell and they offered a quick and satisfactory assessment.  The service department is also first rate making used models shin like new.. When we buy again we will start with Eastside. Max stars!!”
- “We saw an add on Craig's list and were reluctant to stop in since most RV dealers have crazy added fees.  Not here.. only Tax title lic and doc. .  From the moment we arrived Lisa, Mark, Marty and Don were extremely helpful and not pushy at all.  After taking a couple days to decide to make our purchase I wanted to buy new tires for the unit.  Lisa had Don take it to Discount tire for us. We are extremely busy and that took a Huge burden off my shoulders.  They did an excellent job detailing the camper and making sure everything was in working order. Even sealing the roof.  As they were hooking up the camper they noticed the hitch we owned had to be re-adjust  No problem... they gladly corrected it.  I highly recommend you stop in and take a look around. Incredible service!  We are now happy Campers  Thanks for everything Blessings T”

- “i'll second James H. review of this hole in the ground so-called rv dealer. Totally unprofessional, when I entered the yard with my son& wife we were attacked by the owners dogs. In hindsight, I should have called the police. Regardless, the rv's were grossly overpriced, in poor condition both in/outside, also seems like some of the ones we looked @ had SERIOUS water damage ( = costly repairs.) These guys are amateurs...not worth either your time or money. SPREAD THE WORD!”

Thankfully Dr Martin assured me that my vision issues were of a temporary measure. He was very thorough and had me return a couple of times to insure my condition has not got worse. I've been going to eye Drs for sixty years and would say the Barnet Dulany and Perkins are among the best around!”

- “My husband went to this Dr. because he accepted his insurance, all the staff was competent and efficient. He went in wearing a progressive prescription and was charged additional fee to obtain his new prescription. When we went to fill the script, found out Dr. had written a single vision script for reading only.. This is unusable due to fact he needs correction for near and far vision, we have contacted office and they refuse to respond. He now is out the additional fee charged and has a worthless prescription. He will not go back to this Dr. and cannot get his prescription updated without paying another Dr. full fees because he has used his insurance for the year.  I wouldn't recommend this Dr. to anyone.”
- “I was referred to Barnet-Dulaney(BD) by United Healthcare(UH), my AARP Medicare provider. UH told me that it would only cost me $20 copay since BD was an in-network provider. Upon arrival on 9/14/18 the two office workers admitted that they were new but I would be charged $35 referral fee, not $20. I should have walked out then but was pressed for time to get an eye exam before going out of town. I figured UH would straighten it out. Then they gave me an iPad to do the paperwork; more paperwork than normal requiring multiple signatures with obscure questions like do you have bed bugs! This was my second opportunity to leave, thus my second mistake! Most of the eye exam was given to me by a young man (technician?) who never introduced himself. In my previous many eye exams, the optometrist would have given these tests of your vision. So after most of the work was done by this fellow, the optometrist came in to finish the exam. I left the office with only a credit card receipt for $35.00. Now BD sends me a bill: $45 for the eye exam plus $20 for copay. UH has already paid BD $128.20 so my exam costs will total $193.20 ($128.20+45.00+20.00). I should have gone to Target or Costco or one of the eye retail stores and paid only $50. So bottom line, UH/Medicare has paid BD $128.20 plus my $35 (subtotal $163.20) plus BD wants $30 more from me. I have called both BD and UH several times on this problem but it still isn't solved. BD may have filed this under medical instead of Spectara Vision, but I do not know for sure. This example is why Medicare costs taxpayers too much in my opinion. $193.20 for a $50 routine eye exam is ridiculous. My advice: ask how much it will cost before signing the numerous forms at BD. I will not make this mistake again.”

- “Our water heater went out in July, it is now a week before Thanksgiving. Our home warranty company got super drain to come out to give us a quote to replace it. Our water heater is outside unfortunately and we knew we would need an enclosure for it. It took two months but Super drain finally quoted us $1,700 for a small enclosure that our warranty wouldn't cover. We were given the option to build it ourselves and they would bring out and inspector to make sure it was up to code so they could place the new water heater. Fast forward, we built an enclosure with family contractors. We called to let super drain know so they could get someone out here to inspect it and then they told us we did not need the inspection prior to placement and they would come out and place the heater. When the day came around that they were supposed to come out, they never showed up. We called and they gave us an excuse as to why and rescheduled us for another day. This same thing happened about two or three more times. Last week they were supposed to come out and we had to have a family member take off to be there because we couldn't. They didn't show up again so we called and they said they had us scheduled for the following day but we were told a different day. Finally they scheduled us for today, as expected they didn't show up again! We called and were told that now they want an inspector out and can't do it until tomorrow. A few hours go by and we call again, we are then informed that they are refusing to come out at all due to not getting and inspector out prior to and that we built is ourselves. I called back and spoke with Juan A. the company owner. He was very rude and would not let me talk and he was raising his voice with me stating that we went against what he said and built it on our own and that he is not coming out at all now because we didn't let him build the structure. He then hung up on me without another word. Prior to speaking with Juan I was in the phone with the lovely scheduler/receptionist though I cannot remember her name. She was a doll and was very loving and understanding. She had apologized to me because she was being told different things by Juan and that he keeps changing his mind on the situation. Poor girl had to not allow Juan to leave so that he could handle his mess because she has been trying to for the past 4 months. I would not recommend this company at all due to Juan.”
- “I wish I could give them a zero for all of these ratings because that is what they gave me when they came in to help at my home. Not only did the repair man reek of smoke and leave the entire area smelling but he charged me $120 for a snake line which ended up causing me more problems and more money since he did not understand the situation. Appliances that i could not move back myself were left. I asked for my money back and what met with a rude manager who took the side of his repairmen. Save yourself the money, the work and the hardship- go somewhere else.”

Doctor Livingston, whom I can't describe, is a professional with dignity.  Our family at this time, needed someone that understood.  It was so painful to hear what the Doctor had to say. The biggest bandaid will not cure his illness anytime soon. Our time with our Scooter will be well spent until the man above calls him. We thank Doctor Livingston from the bottom of our families hearts. Your staff is very warm and understanding as well.  we can't thank you enough for your kindness and generosity.

- “Pantano Christian Church teaches directly from the Bible (as it should be). They play contemporary music in a very relaxed atmosphere. Come as you are! Everyone is welcome!”
- “Love the music/worship style.  Some people don't like the loud worship, however I love it.  Pastors are nice and gave opportunities to meet them after service.  It's easy to blend in if you want, but there's places to sign up to get more involved if that's what you're wanting.”
- “One of America's great churches. Glen, Roger, Nick, Tall Paul, Robin all do a great job. The Sunday School team is excellent. The seed churches, international outreach, emergency response teams, blogs, baptism, dining facilities all make church impactful, fun and engaging.  I really enjoy PCC. Christ-centered is the way to go and PCC starts there.”

- “BEWARE: If you live together and want to get marred at this church they will not marry you, but will waste your time by not telling you this until you have your first meeting and after they steal your $50.  I would recommend telling a little white lie and tell them you live apart, will save you lots of trouble in the end. Thank you very much we did like this church except for the neverending songs, but the good thing is we will find a better and brighter church.”
- “My wife and I went to about two or three services at PCC and were disappointed at the lack of God's presence and what seemed to be the outright rejection of the Holy Spirit and the spiritual gifts that He desires for the church to possess for the building up of the body of Christ. Because of that, the fruit of the Spirit known as love was not evident there. Everything seemed to be in the flesh. Also, when we attended shortly after moving to Tucson, we needed some help because I didn't have a job and we struggled even on my wife's income. We approached the church for some help and were told we needed to fill out a form (or forms) and would have to wait eight weeks. I've learned that, living in Tucson, you can be in dire straits and end up on the streets in eight weeks or less!  I do not recommend this flesh driven, man driven church at all! Want to attend a church where God leads, where you sense the Holy Spirit's presence as soon as you enter and where you feel welcomed by everyone, including the pastors? Then check out Faith Christian Fellowship of Tucson on the far west side!”
- “Yesterday was our first time visiting. No one welcomes you. Just a fake smile here and there. That is fine because the purpose of going is to worship God. The worship team started to play songs that were not God centered, just words. The worship team tried to hard for impress rather than worship God. Felt like you were at a concert more than anything. There was no prayer and the lead pastor was horrible. All he talked about was how Tucson is and how it needs to change. Only read one verse in the Bible. If you are looking for God and to be changed, do not attend here.”

- “The tuna salad here is amazing! It's a huge, hearty portion that keeps me full for hours. I have also gotten the BLT which was great. The sourdough bread was perfectly toasted and the bacon super thick and perfectly cooked. Also- pick any pastry and you can't go wrong.  I have also been loving the patio during covid. This spot is just as good as the original location.”
- “If you are looking for the best thing between two pieces of sliced bread, have I got a place for you! The American in Paris sandwich was delish! The bread was a whole grain masterpiece. I wanted my eggs over easy and they were. Loved the applewood smoked bacon, not overcooked and the melted cheddar cheese icing on the cake. Next time I would ask for them not to include the tomato aioli as I thought it was a bit too sweet. My husband had the Huevos Rancheros and totally cleaned his plate. My daughter had the breakfast special breakfast burrito and loved it as week  - fresh ingredients that all worked together. And we couldn't get out of there without getting a Le Buzz cookie that the three of us literally devoured. The added bonus? The cheerful, friendly staff. It was really busy and I am pretty sure every single one of them was smiling! I HIGHLY recommend!”
- “What's not to love about LeBuzz? With two beautiful yet different locations it's one of our go to breakfast spots. The east side location is perfect to stop by on the way up to Mt. Lemmon and the central location is just a quick ride from the Rillito River bike path!  From savory to sweet they've got it all covered. My go to breakfasts are the American In Paris, because you can't beat their croissant and applewood bacon or their breakfast burrito. As I said their baked goods are out of this world and the vanilla scone is my personal favorite. Pair those with a cup of coffee from a local favorite Decibel which they serve up in house and you have the perfect breakfast!”

- “We eat here regularly and love it! Great for kids and great price. Get the small salad. It's the best deal!   Extra shout out to the staff. I walked in recently with my 3 kids and within 10 steps of walking into the restaurant one of my kids got stomach sick. The staff (especially the man working the register who saw it) was so incredibly kind and understanding. They went above and beyond sending me out with towels and bottles of water.”
- “Always clean (bathroom and dining) and the staff (especially Sara) is so welcoming and inviting-we have shamelessly driven across town to dine in or carry out...great food & portions, price point and environment”

- “Wow food looks great but calling is a waste of time.no one answers so we went somewhere else.this place must be losing a grip load of cash.I would replace the whole staff.”
- “This Costa Vida in particular is very convenient for me to grab food from. That being said, I've been a handful of times. Generally, I order take out whether that be by calling in or placing my order online. My most recent call in order/in-restaurant experience has deterred me.   I called to place my order, primarily asking if it was possible to order something I had in the past, whether they could pull my order history making this easier on everyone (I thought). The lady on the other end of the call stated that it could be done but then asked me several times to explain my order. Two questions she asked specifically included, 'what kind of beans would you like?' and 'are you still wanting two fountain drinks with your order?' I answered refried and yes to those questions, then we finished our lengthy phone call. (This is all important later.)  I arrive to Costa Vida about 15-20 minutes later to pick up my order as well as a fellow co-workers. The young lady checking me out gives me one cup as my drink order. Me, confused, asks if she's sure I've only ordered one cup (given that the lady on the phone asked flat out whether I wanted two drinks still). She says yes with an attitude, as if the answer was so obvious.   Costa Vida is expensive. They have large portion sizes, so I guess if you look at it that way, what's the harm? Anyway, I check my receipt, because I don't plan on coming back. (I was on a break from work at the time.) Lo and behold, it says I should have gotten two cups. Side note: I was standing off to the side by the pick up area and the way I was approached (by someone else, another younger female) gave me the impression that I was being shoed away (although I was the only one needing to pick up food at the time).  I explain to that lady that on my receipt it says I should've gotten two drinks, she hands me another cup, and without skipping a beat the girl who rang me up doesn't wait for me to leave to make her unprofessional comments.   I get my drinks and everything else needed, then leave. I should have been cued to check my order at the time, but silly me. I go back to work, check my order, and am left even more disappointed than before.   I got the wrong beans (?), they added rice as well as lettuce...this was probably my last visit ever (to this location anyway). The quality of customer service was incredible low. I wouldn't not recommend...”
- “Sorry guys but i had to do it ,   My burrito was horrible  Wet  No flavor Soggy   I know how burritos get when made with salsa and wet carne , but this burro was a bit extreme when it came to soggyness , like i said no flavor not alot of carne in my burrito to even taste it , too much beans in it feel like im just eating a rice and bean burrito .   Wont stop me from eating here for the fact that ive eaten at the northside location 2 and never had a problem.    I think ive reviewed it before and gave it 4-5 stars but eastside location receives 1.    Sorry Guys”

## Tips from customers
Try the new Chile Verde. It's really flavorful and has a spicy kick to it! They are very new at this location so be patient with the staff and don't be afraid to let them know what you want and how you want it Why does this exist... the less I say the more my mom will thank me. Nasty THIS IS NOT real Mexican food but the horchata is good! get the fajitas Great food Amazing Great food! Stake was bomb! They have bottomless horchata!

- “These guys were so nice! My family and I were moving across the country... Driving from California to Texas. Our car broke down in Tucson and we took it here. Turns out the motor was burnt up and it was going to be very expensive to fix it so we decided to replace the car but they didn't even charge us for the diagnostics! They made a really crummy situation a little bit better and we are so thankful for that!”
- “I have had crooked mechanics before so I'm always skeptical about a new mechanic but I've taken my vehicles here several times now and they have been great each time. They even went so far as to walk me into the maintenance bay and show me exactly what was going on with my car.”
- “I've been regularly getting maintenance done by them on both of our cars for the last 3 years. If there was a 6th star available, I'd give it to them. They are always punctual, honest, and really do well with the amount of customers they have come in daily. The waiting area is comfortable, they have WiFi, a counter to get work done at, water fountain and coffee. They are quick in calling about updates to the car as well and will always call to confirm work that has any additional cost than originally planned for. Complimentary tire rotations if all tires were bought through them. We have always been pleased with the results of their work. Car maintenance would be miserable if they weren't here!”

- “Very disappointed with the result of my service. Everything started off fine when I called and asked if they could fix a dead truck that would be towed in. I asked for a diagnostic eval to determine the problem and received a call from Terry informing me that it was a bad fuel pump. It took about about a week for the repair (parts order and then replacement), which is reasonable. When I got the bill, the cost for a replacement fuel pump was over $400. When I got home and researched the cost of a replacement fuel pump, other retailers carried the same part for $85-140. That is an extreme markup and made me wonder if that was a "special" price for an out-of-towner. Although the service experience was good, the excessive part cost is enough for me to recommend you go elsewhere for service.  Pros: - willing to take in a dropped off vehicle via tow truck - easy to work with  Cons: - excessive parts cost”
- “We are very disappointed in this family owned business. Took our truck in for coolant flush and brought it home to still have the original sour smelling coolant. They claim to have done the flush but if it was done correctly and not half assed then we would continue to patron their place of business! For those that don't know there is NOT a universal coolant that's used for all cars! If that's what they tell you then that's crap! They did not offer a do over with (correct) fluid or offer to give us our money back! Not all vehicle take the same fluids! If you wonder why your car is running crappy after a appointment then you'll know why! Please do your homework prior to any car service. Do not hesitate to ask questions. Take pictures of your car part that's being worked on prior and compare them with after pics. Don't be afraid to get a 2nd opinion!”
- “This place definitely lives up to the stigmas often attributed to mechanics. Sadly, I was victimized by this place. I only went to this shady place because it was highly recommended by a friend. I paid over $200 for a battery replacement. What was I to do once the service was completed? I should have definitely shopped around or gone to Costco! F this place; worst mechanic in all of Tucson. You may as well go to the dealer since they at least use Vaseline when they bend you over.”

- “Great event! I can't believe this was my first year attending after living in Tucson for 5 years! The patio of congress is the perfect venue with lots of space.    I attended the Tequila Class which was held inside at the bar by the dance floor. Dave, the old sommelier from Maynards was there with a tequila connoisseur to teach us about the different varieties of agave liquors - tequila, mezcal and bacanora. I'd never tried a bacanora before the Agave fest, wow is it strong! All of the pourers were having a joke with me saying that Bacanora doesn't give you hangovers if it is done right. I didn't have a hangover the next day, so maybe they are right! (or maybe I drank enough water with each tasting, who knows). After the tequila class, my friends and I officially entered the Agave Fest, we were given out landyard with our tickets and we were set loose on the Congress Patio. The Congress bartenders were having a mixed drink contest, and the first drink I tried was my absolute favorite a watermelon/tequila drink with a spicy salt rim. I need the recipe so I can try and make it at home. I tried to taste at least one tequila from ever stand, and I successfully did that with many tickets to spare.   Agave Fest is very well done. Great event! Can't wait till next year!”
- “Best festival ever. We each received 10 red tickets, 3 yellow tickets, and 2 orange tickets with admission. Red tickets were for little sample shots of all things agave, Yellow tickets were for mixed drinks/cocktails at the mini Congress bar, and orange tickets were good for 2 tacos (shredded pork or steak). I thoroughly enjoyed 2/3 of Hotel congress's cocktails. One was almost like a pisco sour, the 2nd was a spicy  salt rimmed watermelon tequila drink and the 3rd was my least favorite.. it literally tasted like lemon juice and tequila.   It was so much fun going throughout the whole festival sampling and learning about the different tequilas and mezcals. Event started at 6.. but the taco line was long so we ended up eating at hotel congress at 6 before we began drinking. Towards 8:15 I would say the taco line started to become non-existent and thats when I decided it would be a good time to get me more food. Options were steak or shredded pork, and there were a good amount of choices at the salsa bar including Nopales!  This was literally one of the best events ever, and I can't wait for next year, oh and props for the nicest shot glass ever that was given out towards the end of the festival. Best useful souvenor ever.”
- “My husband and I had so much fun!   It was our first time attending the 8th Annual Agave Fest (Thanks to Yelp! Whoo hoo!) and it was AWESOME!   The fest had a live band, tons of different agave spirits/cocktails, and the mexican food that was offered was delicious! Water stations were also set-up to keep everyone hydrated. My favorites were the cocktails offered by R Bar, Maynard's, and Hotel Congress. (R Bar for the win though!)  Security seemed to be on top of enforcing the fun and tamed environment.   Overall, I plan to attend next year!”

- “We bought a car here and the process was great. They are friendly and up front. They accommodate odd hours as well.  No pressure sales at all. they are a USAA certified car dealer as well. They work hard to keep that in good standing.  It is local and a hole in the wall but a good late model inventory fairly priced!”
- “This review is a few months late.  However, I had such a great experience purchasing a vehicle from Paramount, I wanted to share my it.    After my previous car needed a new engine, I decided to just purchase another car.  I normally buy a new car from a dealership because I am wary of buying from a used car salesman.  However, because of my current financial status and not prepared for buying another car, I did wanted to keep my car payment under 300 per month and be able to pay it off in four years.    My wife and I looked for a vehicle for under $10,000 while still being under 100,000 miles and in good condition.  We went to a few used car lots and did not find anything close to our parameters.  Additionally, a few salesmen we encountered gave that stereotypical feeling of them trying to pull one over on us.  Then we went to Paramount and met Phillip Lineberry.   At Paramount, we found a 2015 Cruze for around 10,000 and had less than 40,000 miles.  Phillip did not give any pressure and allowed us to decide for ourselves if this was a car for us.  He did not hassle us and was very professional when it came to answering our questions about the process of buying from Paramount.  He worked with our Credit Union to allow them to finance the loan.  Because of his professionalism, we decided to buy a car from Paramount. He even allowed me to take the car to the mechanic of my choosing before I bought it.  During the process, Phillip mentioned their $1,000 mile or 30 day warranty.  Personally, I thought most car dealerships give this promise and assumed it was mostly a gimmick.  However, about two days after I bought the car, I noticed one of the tires had a leak.  I called Philip and he made an appointment at a mechanic to look at the fire.  The tire already had several patches and Phillp had no problem buying two new tires for the car.  Paramount lived up to their warranty.    I am extremely satisfied with my experience with Paramount and their salesman Phillip.  I recommend this place for anyone who is looking for a good price for a good used vehicle.”
- “When it comes to used cars, I wouldn't go anywhere else in Tucson.  I have bought all my cars from Mike at Paramount auto and have never had a problem.  They always have a nice selection of cars for every budget and taste.  They also work hard to get you financed.  I have bought 3 cars from him and my sister has bought hers as well. i recommend anyone looking for a good, honest, used car shop to visit Mike at Paramount auto.  I can't imagine going anywhere else and will continue to bring my business here.”

- “I submitted a CarFax inquiry and received an email response from Carl F, a salesman.  I called him with questions regarding the "2 year maintenance plan", "cost of available used car warranty plans" and the out-the-door price and he promised to get back to me.  Haven't heard back from them. Either they are really rude, or too many devils in the details.  We're local and will definitely not hesitate to share our experience.”
- “BUYERS BEWARE this dealership sells lemons that will break as soon as you get off the lot.  I bought a Boxster S from these crooks it was sold to me with "no known issues".  Car began leaking oil and misfiring right after leaving the lot, I paid $4500 for a rear main seal to be repaired by the car manufacturer.  After this the problem persisted and I now have a worthless vehicle with a totaled engine that is $22k to replace.  Paramount auto is in the scam business not auto sales.”

- “I visited with out of town guests . i was embarrassed at the lack of decor and fixtures.  This area has long needed a new operator since Dave Talbot left us.    The motif seems not be in the grasp of the  management . Perhaps if the management would spend less time addressing each and every review { even commenting on decent reviews} and more time on physical supervision he would better serve his purpose. The management even takes reviewers to task when they fail to mention all of the elements of the establishment eg. food, service ,price, presentation etc.    The food was indeed lacking in presentation and quality. The service was poor during even during a slow period. Overpriced and not to standard .     I qualify my review on experienced world travel and having had 3 restaurants.”

Food was better than expected. Service was friendly.  It worked!  Try it.

Ok so I came back on January 27.  The drinks were watered down.  We got appetizers all were not seasoned and the cheese chorizo dip is Velvita.  The server could not keep up with the customers.  The service is horrible.  What a disaster. Service used to be slow, but it's gotten a lot better.  Most of the food is good; our favorite is the nachos with carne asada.  Definitely worth trying!

Drinking Prairie Pink Guava Funk on tap!!!! Great outdoor seating.  Nice view and ambiance. Their reservation system is either garbage or their staff doesn't care to input the reservation when you call.

Great food Always love going there good food and good service the entertain is always excellent Love the place Great atmosphere. Great Bloody Mary. Great service. Good food. Friendly staff and good service. Good service, and tacos. The margaritas are awful. I think it's the mix they are using. Stick to the beer if you want an alcoholic beverage. The food was wonderful. It's a lot of food for a good price. Carnitas tacos and mahi tacos are great! I will come back for happy hour! Nice little lunch on our way to the park. Great views of the wild life. Beautiful scenery, great food and awesome service! The avocado BLT was wonderful! Nice salads, Fish tacos really good. Will definitely go back!! Awesome omelet light fluffy and not runny.

- “I needed to replace an outside mirror on my Chevrolet Impala. So, I stopped into National Auto to get a quote, which was done for me on the spot. Excellent customer service. I was greeted immediately and asked what service repair I needed. The quote was provided to me in less than 10 min. They said to just call when I was ready to order the part and have them install the new mirror. Within a week or so, I called and ordered the part. It took 24-48hrs to get the part and to have it painted to match my vehicle. I am pleased with all the employees great service, friendliness, and professionalism. Thank you National Auto Collision for making my visit painless! I would recommend this business to others needing any bodywork done on their cars.”
- “My car got into a fight with a pole, and the pole won. I had heard good things about these guys, so I went and got a quote. They are a preferred shop through Allstate, my insurance company, so getting a claim was super easy. My car was repaired sooner than expected, and it looked good as new. Friendly service, and their front desk agent has a great sense of humor. I hope I won't need to go back, but if a pole attacks me again I won't hesitate to take it to national auto!”
- “My driver's side door panel was loose & I first went to an auto repair shop.  They told me it would best be fixed by an auto body repair shop because of the parts needed to fix it.  Farrah Brown at Top Notch referred me to them & my experience was the very best.  I had asked that they inspect all the door panels which they did & found I had 3 that were in need of repair.  Because they didn't know until the door panels would be removed just how many clips would be needed , Bella gave me estimates from the lowest to the highest price for doing the repairs.   When all the clips came in I scheduled an appointment & the work was all completed in the one visit.    As far as the price for the parts & the labor, I was very satisfied.  The staff were all very friendly & helpful.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for an honest, reputable business.  We need more like them in this world.  Carol Lundberg”

- “Took my car in for repair. Was given 2 estimates. I accepted the lower estimate (was never told it would not hold up in the long run). The lower estimate was for 4 hours work. It only took 2 hours to repair and when I mentioned it they told me I had already accepted the 4 hour estimate. Plus 2 weeks after the initial repair, my husband took it back and a very nice young lady had a service person add a screw to hold it in place. Had to take it back again, screw did not hold. Manager refused to do any more to solve the problem.  Then when i complained, manager at Broadway location lied about the whole incident. NEVER TAKE YOUR CAR TO THEM!!”
- “Very bad experience my vehicle was over a week late the only excuse I continued to hear was the part they ordered was damaged,I don't understand how you can get the same part damaged four different times but maybe you should get your parts from somewhere else. I would not go back here again or recommend this shop to anyone I know,if you need your vehicle  back quickly and as good as new do not take it here. I'm not sure what the woman in the backs job is I've seen her watching tv shows every time I've come in,the brunette young lady at the front desk was very nice,helpful!”

- “Great store in a great location. Ample, free parking in an area that has various stores to choose from as well as different places to eat or grab a snack or coffee to keep you going.  There were variety of things to look at mostly were seasonal but others appeared to be your round items you could use in your home. They had different areas for the home, including a small area for work spaces. It kind of reminded me of being in a World Market and Ross put together. I really appreciated the highly discounted prices for what appeared to be quality items. I was happy to see that those friendly staff available if you had a questions or that could be found. In my experience in shopping at stores similar to this one, it's difficult to locate store associates or at least to find ones that are willing to help you find what you're looking for.  I left with some pretty good finds including a stainless steel steak knife set for $9.99, a stainless steel toilet cleaner with this beautiful see through faux crystal handle also $9.99 & a wood sandwich playset that for my fussy toddler that refused to let go of it for just under $15.”
- “I am always a fan of a HomeGoods store. Great location, nice staff, clean store, and great selection! Love it!”
- “I absolutely adored Genesis! She was so kind and helpful, very welcoming and answered all my questions and made sure i found everything i needed! Very nice young lady!”

- “Guess who has a brand spanking new candy thermometer? Guess who watched a Halloween episode of Giada At Home and is going to make marshmallows this weekend? If you guessed me, keep reading...  I've long been confused about why Economy stocks certain things and other things are special order, but this week, it didn't make a difference. I called over and asked whether or not they had candy thermometers and they sure do! This one is much nicer than what I saw at Target, and cheaper too. The gentlemen on the phone was really kind to tell me the price, I sped over there, and I was out in under five minutes with my new culinary toy. I'm a fan of you Economy. A big fan.”
- “I was really impressed by this place.  My best friend is opening a new gluten free bakery in Tucson and we came here to stock up on supplies.  We were there pretty early, and employees were all alert and resourceful, and the goods themselves were able to fill a lot of my friend's needs at very reasonable prices.  It was clean, well-organized, and well laid out - this place is ideal for anyone looking to either set up their own shop or just get some fun kitchen gadgets.  Definitely recommend if you're on the hunt for restaurant necessities!”

- “I drove in to Jiffy Lube at Speedway and Sycamore mid morning on a Tuesday with the truck I'd recently bought.  Jacob was informative, professional, when I explained time was a factor he was quick.  I got the oil/lub/filter I walked in for, a new air filter to replace the dirty one they showed me, a new fuel filter (because they said it would only take another 5-6 minutes and it did) and a list of all the manufacturer-recommended maintenance schedules.  On my way out they took the time to diagnose a misadjusted windshield wiper and fix it... without charging me anything.  On top of all of that, they said my total repair qualified for a discount of $50 and gave it to me without my having to do anything, say anything, clip a coupon, dance on one foot, or remember a password.  Nice!  I will come back to this Jiffy Lube.  Oh yes.  I will!!!  Ehud Gavron Tucson AZ 2006 Dodge Ram 3500”
- “Our service here was amazing. Richard Juhl was polite and friendly and all the guys got us in and out quickly. I definitely will be going to this Jiffy Lube exclusively for my next oil change.”
- “Joe manager and his team had me in and out so fast i couldn't believe it. Joe was incredibly courteous, informative, and just plain awesome in his demeanor. I have always had a good experience at Jiffy Lube but this was above and beyond. Thanks guys! I know where I'm going for my next service.”

- “Today I was driving by and saw the staff outside with no wait signs so I stopped for an oil change. They proceeded to try to upsale everything. They brought both my internal h-vac air filter and my engine air filter showing me how dirty they were and needed changing. I asked them to just tap the internal one before putting it back in because it had a bunch of debris on it and I will change it myself. The man at the counter acted annoyed with me. Verging on rude. He went back outside.  When I drove away and turned back on my air the vibration in my dash was bad. I thought what did the do when putting the filter back. So I pulled my glove box and the filter and all the lint debris was still there I asked them to tap off. I have a 2013 car and they did something because the fan was now vibrating like an off balanced wash machine. I slid my camera phone in and took a picture. My h-vac fan was now full of dried up cactus. Are you kidding me! I had to drop the fan to clean out their mess! Never again will I patronize their facility. They think because your a woman your stupid.”
- “These guys were goons. If you give them an inch they'll make sure they try and take you for a mile.   Turns out the conventional oil I purchased will in fact be just fine. Also, I have reasonable doubt about the other claims made about my ever so distressed vehicle. I say "reasonable", because I googled the list of bologna I was fed the very second I came home.   Rest assured, folks. Everything is a-okay.   On a brighter note, this real cute kid introduced himself in the lobby and showed off his recently developed ability to count to one-hundred. I was more impressed with the boy's speedy, accurate, numerical 'yelps'  than I was with the service I was paying for. Next time I'll just go to Pep Boys and then watch a couple Youtube tutorials.”
- “After being greeted by a super friendly worker. We were treated absolutely terribly by everyone else at this location. The larger white man doing another oil change on a vehicle that wasn't even ours continued to bark orders at me and give me bad looks. I have never felt so uncomfortable in a professional environment!! It seemed like everyone at this location was effected by this one mans terrible attitude. I left. I would not ever go back. In my personal opinion this guy should be fired. He's scaring away business and giving that jiffy lube location a very bad name”

## Tips from customers
Fast service, and very friendly technicians... Just be sure to get a 2nd Opinion on their analysis of your vehicle prior to agreeing to an offer of a service you didn't ask for-- They're trained to up-sell, even if your car isn't in serious need of such servicing. Due To the pandemic, you need to sit in your car while you're getting your service done Fast and professional service. Very helpful staff Crazy fast and professional! Amazing service! By the time I filled out my paperwork my oil change was done! Great service, stopped in and was in and out within the hour. Great service. They did a wonderful job and it's was fast and efficient! Super fast and courteous! They were amazing! Very helpful and quick. Highly recommend! Fast, thorough, and friendly service. Never had to wait here, pricing reasonable. Super fast and did not overly pressure me into anything. Overall great experience. Quick and easy! Wonderful deals for first responders!

- “They are horrible people who almost ruined my car. I turned over my car to a valet to park and he locked the keys in it while it was idling. By the time the locksmith opened it, 90 minutes later, the car was overheating badly. I tried adding radiator fluid, but it still overheated every time I idled. I finally took it into a mechanic to fix it. The owner of the rides refused to pay for the mechanic or even refund our money. The valet took money out of his pocket to help, but the owners never reimbursed him. They also told us these were "hayrides". In fact, it was a crammed shuttle pulled by a diesel belching jeep. We were all in bad moods for the holidays after this. I cannot think of a worst Christmas experience I've ever had. If you do decide to go walk or drive your own car in. Never, ever take this overpriced sham of a ride.”

- “Beautiful spanish mission style building. Well maintained interior. Solid word of the lord.”
- “The Little Shop is a great place to get gifts, cards, and books for all sorts of occasions. Mostly religious in nature, it is located on the campus of St. Philip's in the Hills Episcopal Church at River and Campbell. It is a non-profit business, and all proceeds go to support the mission and ministries of St. Philip's Episcopal Church.”
- “St Philip's In the Hills, is a wonderful corporate size church, whose architecture lends to a feeling of intimacy  The sanctuary pews are setup in the traditional way, with two rows down the center, with additional pews on either side.  This gives a feeling of intimacy that I spoke about, since each pew only sits four and the side pews only two or three.  Up front, the Celebrant, Assisting clergy and Deacons all sit the right of the Alter, while readers sit in the front row near the lectern.   We came here this past Sunday and was fortunate enough to see John Kitagawa celebrate at the 11:15 service.  He has a wonderful preaching style and I would recommend his homilies.  If you are a music, or choir lover, then you will be taken aback by how good the acoustics are here.  The lack of carpeting allows the notes and hymns to resonate and bounce throughout the church. Incredible. Clearly the guest organist was enjoying himself, pulling out all the different stops. So did we!  In case you miss it, printed in a large font in the service bulletin that "All are welcome at God's table for communion."  To say that St Philip has a variety of services to suit each individual, would be an understatement.  Here's a sampling:  7:45 a.m.  Holy Eucharist Rite I   9:00 a.m.  Sung Eucharist Rite II -- Eucharist using more modern language, led by their St. Philip's Singers.  11:15 a.m.  Sung Eucharist Rite II -- Eucharist using slightly more traditional liturgical elements led by their Canterbury Choir.  4:00 p.m.  "Come and See" Service (Music Center)-- A non-traditional, participatory liturgy with inclusive language, intended for those who are exploring their faith journey   5:30 p.m.  Holy Eucharist Rite II with homily   In their Welcoming Statement, they say they are "inclusive Christian community striving through worship, love and service to welcome all people just as God created them."   "No matter where you are on your journey of faith, and whether you are single, married, divorced, separated, or partnered, our welcome knows no boundaries of age, race, ethnicity, culture, gender identity, sexual orientation, economic condition, physical or mental ability."  Nice!  Go in Peace, to Love and Serve the Lord!”

- “I used to love walking around shopping this market before the world changed.  Even though it isn't quite as fun to drive through it is definitely convenient and I am just happy to be able to get my produce and support them.  There are weeks you can just drive up and make your selection immediately and then there are times you have to wait in a long line and when you get to the front your options are very limited.  Either way they post their menu on Facebook every week and the selection is still pretty great.  All of the staff are always upbeat and very friendly and helpful.  I'm grateful that they are finding a way to continue doing this!”
- “I went to this farmers market for the first time last week and I have to say that I was impressed. It's a lot smaller than some of the other markets in town but there was a great selection of fresh, locally grown produce,nuts,honey,herbs,etc.. You can buy herb plants to start your own herb garden, and get seeds from the public library's "seed library". There was live music to enjoy as we sat on the patio and ate homemade organic hummus and crispy flatbread. The crowd was friendly and relaxed. It was a great way to spend a Thursday afternoon. The market is open every Thursday from 3pm-6pm. Parking is good and the area is wheelchair accessible .”

- “Over the 2.5 months we employed the Maid Connection, we were gradually packing up what we could pack up, readying for a move into an independent living community.  Calling around to maid services, The Maid Connection was one of the few willing to quote an hourly rate and work from my 'to do' list.  The rate was reasonable, the teams prompt, competent, and fast.   The office end of things is well managed.”
- “We have used the Maid Connection for many years and are thoroughly satisfied with their services and cost. The Maid Connection has always sent first class house cleaners who work efficiently. We have no hesitation in trusting them with the keys to the house and having them work while we are away, When we have had problems we just called the office and the problems were quickly sorted out. The Maid Connection has always accommodated requests such as changing times and days to meet a special need or adding the cleaning of our casita after we have had guests.”
- “I have the ladies come every other week and clean our house, just to save me the time, energy, and anxiety with working out of town and my husband not being the master of clean, if you know what I mean. Not only did Michele set us up with a great rate, but the gals make quick work of what would take me half a Saturday to do. Instead I can play with my kids and get the rest of the errands done. The gals are timely, friendly, and obviously do a great job. I've had to reschedule once due to travel, and Michele helped me work it out so I could still get the house cleaned before we left. I recommend the Maid Connection!”

- “The lady who answered the phone was beyond nice. Sadly, they couldn't deliver today but I wasn't worried about that at all. She said it would be done in 20 minutes and sure thing, it was. The pizza was amazing. Just perfect!”
- “Ok, at the risk of getting flamed, I tend to be one of those guys who does pizza only as a last resort. For me, it's sort of the "I give up" food, like when you're installing flooring all day, have a ravenous appetite and have no will or energy to cook and don't look decent enough to go out.  Then it's pizza. "What shall we eat?" "I guess it will need to be pizza or something." "(Groooaaannn) Yes, I suppose so."  Maybe it's because I'm not from NY or Chicago. Or maybe because I ate so much bad cheap pizza at various birthday parties and would rather eat black licorice than more of that crappy pizza.  In any event, we ended up "having" to do pizza a couple of nights ago, so we ordered a special at the nearby BZ, along with an order of bruschetta.  One word: "Holy!" (That would have been more descriptive had I not limited myself to one word.)  This is good stuff. Like seriously good food, with good taste, texture, presentation. This is on a par with actual foodie food, and may have actually turned me into a pizza fan!  So count me now as a fan of BZ. I think we shall give it another go right now!”

- “I have never written a negative review before as you can see from my past reviews but.....IT WAS THE WORST SERVICE EVER. When the manager tells you not to come back don't.  I wanted this place to make it but with a manager like they have they will fail like all the rest. Food is good not great. Calzones are better at Mama's, beer specials for happy hour aren't great, and wine was filled about half full in a small wine glass. Pasta dishes are very high priced as well. I saw a couple of friends while I was there and will make sure all of them DONT COME BACK.  MANAGER MADE NOTHING BUT EXCUSES... I have lived on eastside all my life and will tell everyone to go across the street to New York if they want pizza. Oh and waited 30 minutes for the bill after asking 4 times.”
- “I REALLY wanted to like this place my philosophy is you cannot fuck up a pizza. I ordered a bud light and the waiter didn't even card me I had JUST turned 21 and I was very surprised. We ordered a starter of wings half buffalo and half garlic parm the buffalo ones were pretty good not too hot but just enough to burn a little. The garlic ones however were like someone dipped the wings in Alfredo sauce. It was gross. Our waiter was also the hostess she was running around like crazy. She was good about drinks but I ordered the Bz special I believe it called that comes with sausage, pepperoni, onion and peppers. I asked for "half with no peppers and onions." When it came out one half had onion and the other peppers. I asked another waiter since ours had been absent for 5-10 min and told her the order wasn't right. Then our waiter showed up and asked so you want half without peppers and onions? And I told her yes. When she came around and apologized later she smelled like vodka and cigarettes. I'm writing this review while waiting for my corrected pizza....”
- “Sadly this place has closed! I will miss my beer conversations with Mike, and the great beers he provided at a great price! I hope they open in a new location where the LL is not a greedy POS! I'll miss you guys and the good times I have had in your establishment!”

- “Yum, yum and yum.  Tonight we were seated and served quickly & efficiently.  The place looks and smells great from the moment you walk in.  My son inhaled his Caesar salad and I enjoyed the light flavor of the mixed green salad.  The filet mignon was cooked to perfection with tons of flavor.  I had the green beans (trying to be "good")- even though they were cooked well (al dente), they didn't have much flavor.  However, the sweet potato fries are not to be missed - best I've had in a looong time!  Highly recommend.”
- “Another 5 star experience!!  On Friday, June 19, we ventured out for dinner and so happy we came here! We ordered the special $33/person and it was delicious. Most importantly, our server Mark was amazing! Thanks Mark for creating a positive experience!!   I'm happy with the consistent high level of customer service in addition to delicious food option”

- “I don't know what was happening or if it's always like this but it was a disaster tonight. Their prime rib was tough and chewy and not juicy at all. My burger was so salty like it was the only seasoning they had. My fries were supposed to be seasoned but they were salty to the point where I couldn't finish them which was disappointing because I usually love fries. My moms Ahi was good and she got that with a salad and she said their dressing was really good. Then we got their churro dessert and it was so disgusting. If you're in love with old grease then this dessert is for you. The whipped cream and chocolate "pudding thing" tasted like it had more sugar than anything else in it. Bottom line it was overly sweet. The thing that surprised us all was the waitress. She would ask us how everything was and we said all of this to her but all she would say was "oh okay" then rush off without actually doing anything about it. She ended up charging us full price for everything. I work in the service industry and when I get a complaint like that I comp everything that caused a problem. Just very unprofessional in my opinion. So to close this off don't go here because the price doesn't match the quality. I've had better for lower price.”
- “NO......just.....NO!  The place looked like a ski lodge only w worse food.  Service was great (as it tends to be in fancy chain restaurants) and that's why I gave one star.  The tortilla soup was so thick you could stand your fork up in it.   The ribs had the flavor of artificial flavoring and were most likely boil-in-the-bag.  I don't even remember what I had but I believe it to have been some sort of sandwich.   Who cares.  Please leave or city.  You and your bullshit cookie-cutter types are not what Tucson's dining scene is about.   The shame of La Encatada.”
- “I actually had the worst prime rib of my life here.   It was completely over cooked and grey. I sent it back twice! Finally they were kind enough to comp my meal as I was unable to eat it.”

## Tips from customers
Happy Hour is a steal! The Double Black Diamond very tasty has NY Strip and Ribeye. Staff was friendly. Delicious spinach salad! The bread is awesome! Great service. And the best Kobe Beef meatloaf! Killer Happy Hour from 4-7 M-F. Leslie, Left message for you today with hostess. Steve Prime Rib daily after 4pm. It is outstanding! Great lunch options Good food don't go on weekend nights too busy and chaotic long waits even with reservations Awesome service Must have a Double Black Diamond!! Here for dinner. Steak was pretty good. Port mushrooms very good! I'd say come in during the evening on a work night or maybe for lunch. It's not too crowded or noisy. Once the weekend hits though, it gets crowded and noisy! So make a reservation in advance if you're part of a group! Best place in town for prime rib! Absolute splendid Great early bird special Great happy hour been going here many years still awesome! Good for lunch! Try the crab cake salad. Looking forward to maybe a great steak :-) Amazing drinks....04/19/18 The drinks have a severely downgraded! You used to have the best double diamond! Since coming back to AZ and visiting, the diamond is more like a cubic zirconia! Put the diamond back and give the signature drink it's guts back! Out food was outstanding. The server we had was mediocre :( Waiting for a server might need to go when you have plenty of time on your hands Green chile Mac and cheese! Beautiful dinner Chain restaurant with mediocre food Fantastic food and service! When in Tucson and in Northern Foothills need to stop here! Delicious and great atmosphere!!! The Crispy Mahi Mahi tacos are amazing!! Excellent service. The pineapple martini for $5 happy hour was amazing! Great pineapple martinis for 5$ happy hour! Highly recommended. They never took the time to respond to the poor service noted before. The fresh loaves of homemeade hot bread are amazing! Best prime Rib ever and not BLT salad. The Durango burger is my fav!! Delicious! Food was great. Service was ideal. We'll be back for sure. Our server Luke was awesome !! The seasonal medallions with shrimp was good. Mondays are half price wine on the basic list. Fabulous burgers, prime Rib, ambiance and value for money Great restaurant!

- “A friend of mine was out of town and storing her bike at my house. I brought it by for a tune up to surprise her - what a surprise! When she got back she said it rode better than ever before! Best part was that it did not cost an arm and a leg. Friendly, helpful service across the board and an awesome selection. Would not go any place else.”

- “We bought inner tubes here and the port where you put the air in tore off.  Clearly defective, but they refused to take the tube back for a refund.  What is the use of buying local?  I'm going to Oro Valley Bicycles or Metro Gnome instead for superior service.”
- “Poor service. Went in for a warranty issue on my  rear hub. Ended up finding one, but gave it to someone else?  I was left trying to repair the bike with parts I found on craigslist.  Then, my dropper post went out and I asked them to re-cable it. They did not re-cable the dropper post with a new cable and new housing, they gave it back to me in virtually the same condition I left it. They did put a new endcap on the cabling near the remote lever.  Very disappointed.”
- “Very disappointed in their bike repair services. I had to bring my bike in twice for the same issue because they did not fix it the first time. The repair tech was argumentative and unhelpful. He charged me twice to fix his mistake! I had a similar problem with this shop last year as well but decided to give them a second chance. Big mistake! I will not be back. There are too many great bike shops in town to deal with this poor of service.”

- “Excellent food and a pleasing atmosphere. We especially liked the enclosed courtyard. Good food, good service, and some laughs on the way out. Can't ask for more than that!”
- “This is a wonderful 3 meal restaurant that beckons you to return. And to return with your out-of-town guests. You can sit outside or inside....either is very nice and relaxing.  While I've eaten there several times in the past, today I had the veggie Quiche of the Day: Full of cheeses, olives, onions, and peppers on a whole wheat crust. Very tasty and generous in size. It came with a delicious tomato-dill soup; a  fruit bowl of strawberries, grapes, and apples; and French bread. I did not leave hungry.  My partner got the apple salad which she pronounced "magnificent." Mixed together were glazed pecans, apples,, goat cheese, and vinaigrette salad dressing.  As we paid our bill in the gift shop, I spotted a lemon cookie and had to buy it.. Oh, boy, was that a good cookie!  I don't why we waited so long to return but we'll work on that angle.”

- “Worst chili I ever had! Started patronizing them again, now never. Took one spoonful, that's not chili. Didn't eat any more.”
- “Can I give a review for no service?  I saw the great reviews and thought wouldn't it be nice to pick up some sandwiches for a picnic. So it was 10:40 and at first it seemed like. No problem we started to order. Then a supervisor/manager? Came over and said "sorry no lunch until 11am" really? We were going to take out three simple sandwiches but it seemed to difficult for them. However if we sat and waited 20 minutes to order no problem. We left and found a friendlier more accommodating place down the road. Sometimes it seems places get a little to full of themselves.”
- “Awful. We came in around 2pm, the place was quiet. No greeting, just "sit wherever you want". The stir fry was bland and didn't taste fresh. The toast was nearly untoasted, the crepes only saw the pan on one side, there was a hair on my plate and the Nutella package looked like it sat on the floor for a week. No sorry, no manager. Just sad.”

Me & BF finally tried breakfast here at the Blue Willow. We sat in the beautiful covered patio. The food & service were very good. Will return to try dinner. Good, slightly "different" menu. Fruit crepe was good, if dominated by cinnamon whipped cream. Awesome gift shop! Really cute atmosphere. Excited to try the food :) Huge breakfast menu and best gift shop ever!

Breakfast was delish and staff were incredibly sweet. Free easy to use wifi means I'll be coming back to eat and work on my doctorate a lot! So much food! Sit on the patio, people watch, and take home leftovers because there probably will be some. Service seems fast & friendly, cute little gift shop. A vegan and gluten free menus offered. A gift shop with many cute items. Still horrible just three words:
no dogs allowed Classic Tucson feel! I have always loved The Blue Willow. Today my kids are eating here for the first time, so we'll see what they think. They ordered he fresh fruit crepes and tofu scramble (one of mainstays here) and I'm trying the vegan breakfast burrito. Bon apetit! No limp bacon. Bacon is precooked. Simple but creative omelet options, and only 50 cents to get all egg whites! We love this place! Food was delicious and service was awesome Excellent food and service.  The chorizo scramble rocks All hype. You can make better tasting food with the same ingredients at home. Amazing atmosphere, amazing food, amazing time! Easter brunch here was extraordinary! Omelettes are bland, cappuccino bitter. Get the French toast and a chai tea latte Jenny is the best server! Professional, informed, attentive without hovering. Excellent experience!

- “Flat roof was removed down to the plywood. A few panels were replaced along with some facia boards. They replaced 5 skylights and a turbine as well as all vents, etc.   The crew was professional; each person seemed to know what to do and did it. The supervisor, Pedro, did an excellent job; he himself was hands-on and really hard working as was the rest of the crew in a hot and for Tucson very humid situation.   They were the low bid by a factor of 2; while I do not normally necessarily choose the low bid, I felt confident in doing so here given the length of time they have been in business and the majority of reviews. John did a fine job with the inspection and bid process, and was on site each day and returned afterwards to check on the work. They will return to do any needed touch-up once my solar panels and new pool solar are in place. I am most pleased with what was done; I have no reason not to assume the roof will hold up well.  From my experience, I recommend them highly.”
- “they gave me the cheapest estimate, which gave me pause... they were a few thousand less then another estimate from another company.  could they be as good?  YES.  Salesman was very informative and walked me though options and the installation was smooth.  The new roof is really on there, nothing like my old roof even when it was new.  I recommend you at least talk to them before going with someone else.”
- “I had a roof leak.  The estimator knew his stuff, the repair was priced fairly and done competently.  They showed up when they said they would and cleaned up properly.”

- “Chic rénovation with all the accommodations you would like from a bigger hotel except the rooms are smaller. They provided friendly customer service and we enjoyed the late night live music and food in the lounge.”
- “This was an amazing stay. My only regret is that we were only passing through for one night on our way to Vegas. We called the previous night and helped by Rhiannon. I cannot say enough great things about her. She was extremely friendly, warm, and inviting. Upon arrival the next evening she was there to greet us. She remembered our names and was so helpful in accommodating to our 4 legged baby girl. The room was immaculate and beautifully designed. Also, the location is right off of I-10 so it is centrally located close to many different spots to eat. The entire location had a boutique hotel feel to it. Great stay, super clean, and very welcoming.”
- “This review is going to solemnly be based off of the customer service we received from Alecia. ( I'm so sorry if I misspelled it!!) First night stay into our room we were already having issues with our restroom not functioning which resulted In us having to change rooms, no problem, thankful they could accommodate us! But once we arrived into the new room we had to go out to eat with the family we were visiting so we couldn't check out the room until later that night and it turned out to have a whole wall without power. We were very upset with the situation since we already had to move rooms once, however, Alecia came to our rescue and did her best to accommodate us for our situation and went above and beyond by getting us a discounted rate with some drink cards and had maintenance come out first thing in the morning so we wouldn't have to change rooms. Also shoutout to Paul! Such a sweet, kind man who had our room up and running within 10 minutes!!  These two completely saved our vacation and our stay and we we're so happy they were there to help us.  Only complaint we have afterwards is the bartender Misty who has a huge attitude issue if you're not spending money with her at the bar. While we waited for our room to be switched and fixed they seemed annoyed at the fact we were waiting for Front Desk and asked us " Do you need something?" And as we mentioned we were waiting for front desk she simply said " Okay then sit down. " In a very rude voice.  Besides her and the room mishaps, we had a pleasant stay thanks to Alecia going above and beyond for us. She deserves recognition and higher praise for all she does! Thank you Alecia!”

- “I need to call it as it is. Probably the first 1 star rating of a Marriott property ever for me. I would probably title it something like "putting lipstick on a pig". I need to qualify this review first--- if you're born after 1980, don't take this review too seriously. If you're born before 1980, you may want to consider other properties. I was able to stay with one of my Marriott Reward Free Night Certificates. No way this should be 35,000 points. Maybe 5000. What was crazy was after my GPS took me there, I still couldn't believe I was at the right hotel. I reset my GPS and put the street location in, took off, and it took me around the block again. Depending on how you drive, it may take you into an interesting residential area you would probably not visit otherwise. This is a "Design Hotel". I get it!! Just not directly off the highway next to a Motel 6 and Travelodge. This was a remodeled hotel straight from Amarillo's Route 66. A true motor lodge. Millenials and Gen Z's would call this bougie or retro. I call it a rip off and overstated. It's not the Thunderbird Hotel of downtown Savannah. Now that's bougie!! Cut to the check-in process---- masks are optional, but staff was wearing most of the time. They have a mobile type check in process. Even though this was a comp night, they still took my credit card to charge $100 for incidentals. Did they recognize my Marriott status? No. Was I offered any Titanium perks? No.  My room was just slightly smaller than a college dorm. It did have a walk in shower which was difficult to get in and out of without hitting the toilet. A couple of long strands of black hair were on the shower tile. But that's not all. The toilet was never cleaned and flushed. An awful sandy residue was in it until I needed to use it. When laying in bed, I noticed a huge black fly on the ceiling. I was able to smack it with my belt and saw it land across the room. I hope housekeeping found it this time. With all the highway noise right outside my room, I was still able to get around 4 hrs sleep.  On the 1 star side, I called to find out where the fitness center was and if they had treadmills. The attendant said it was in the main area and had 1 treadmill. To my surprise, it was in the pool area and actually had 2 treadmills. They were probably the nicest treadmills of any hotel I'd stayed at. They were brand new NordicTracs. They also had a Peloton cycle as well as a weight room. The only thing they didn't have were towels.  For breakfast, I had their Lox Sandwich. It was very good.  Looking for other options for eating? There's a Waffle House within walking distance. There's also a local diner type "all you can eat buffet" place. I'm sure that will give y'all that true bougie experience.”
- “Looking for food poisoning? Want to stay in a hipster motel 6 with bugs? The food that they served here, was unsafe. You could have found better food at the fyre festival. The chicken was inedible really just microwaved, the other chicken dish, was nearly frozen in the inside, and tough and had a minor chemical taste. They ran out of pork so they substituted chicken without mentioning it. The sandwich, I don't know how, it says if it's a special skill to make it worse than airline food. I mean we're talking aeroflot. I've worked in kitchens before, clearly this cook was either stoned or reckless.  If you have kids, this is not the place to stay, if you're looking for a cool poolside vibe, this is not the place to stay. This is nothing more than a converted motel 6 with some hipster accents. Pay the extra 30 bucks and stay somewhere else.  Also worth mentioning, nothing better than being locked inside the premise without the ability to leave (huuuge fire hazard!).  And as for the room, I think I said enough here. It was disgusting. I have stayed in many third world countries, and I've seen better in Bangladesh”
- “This is not a Marriott property. Well I guess it is but as someone who has earned lifetime platinum, I've stayed at MANY Marriott properties.  As a platinum member I'm used to a bottle of water - the front desk offered to fill my hydro flask with tap water and ice because they don't have any bottled water.   I forgot toothpaste and they have none.  Not even to buy and he told me "maybe circle K or Walmart".  FYI - circle K doesn't have toothpaste either. Front staff not wearing a mask any of the 3 times I went to the front desk.   I WAS wearing a mask so he would put it on once he crossed the room and came near me.    The AC in the room has to be close to 100 decibels.  Maybe because there is no carpet it sounds louder than any AC I've ever heard.   No closet - no coat hangers - no iron in the room so don't plan to unpack or iron before a business meeting!  Just don't stay here.   Rooms are clean and "chic" so someone spent $$$$ to upgrade this motel but it is not in a safe area of town for solo travelers.”

- “The staff at Dan's is professional, knowledgable and expedient.  I have had nothing but positive experiences in the years that I have taken my Toyota vehicles to them for service. Not only can I count on quality work at a fair price, but also honest assessments of what my truck needs to keep it running at its best.  I've never felt pressured into anything that wasn't a needed part or service. I really can't recommend Dan's highly enough!”
- “This place gives excellent and trust-worthy service.  The front end women are well-informed of both the abilities and timing of the mechanic's work.  The pricing is fair, and certainly MUCH less than taking to a compulsively shister and just plain dishonest dealer like Precision Toyota.   They know just what needs to be serviced and how much they need to charge in advance of the work being done.  They are also located right at a bus stop and have a very comfortable waiting area with free custom made coffee and  filtered hot & cold water.  Even the rest room is large & kept spotlessly clean.”
- “Small, personable shop. Excellent and friendly customer service. Fair prices. I dropped by without an appointment because my headlights had gone out on my Prius. They were busy but fortunately were able to fit me it that morning. The waiting room was comfortable and neat, the bathroom was clean and they had a nice selection of Keurig coffees. Unexpected auto costs suck but Dan's Toy Shop made the experience pleasant.”

- “I had to laugh at your response to my 2015 review of Dan's Toy Shop as it was YOU who was rude to me over the phone. Your attitude was pure entitlement and lacked any sense of customer service. Counsel youself on your attitude.”
- “I needed to find a new shop in town do to a move from the northwest side.  Dans toy shop was recommended by 2 friends.  I called to schedule a service and asked if they had access to the Toyota maintenance schedule so the proper scheduled maintenance can be done.  I was told yes.  When I went to get the service I was told that they don't go off some "arbitrary list" and do a 62 point inspection.  They then fix what they find.  That's great, but Toyota has certain items that are replaced at specific intervals.  These items may appear fine but still are recommended to be replaced.  I told them that wasn't going to work for me if they can't make sure they follow Toyota's recommended maintenance.  I am very disappointed.  I was planning on being a longterm customer provided the actual maintenance was good.”
- “Dan's has a good reputation and I have used them in few times in the past without incident BUT this time was a disaster. The receptionist from the start was argumentative and it was her way or none. I spoke with the manager who was also rude. I will not go back and will make sure others know about my experience.”

## Tips from customers
Great service and honest. Excellent service and value compared to a dealer.

- “The staff is amazing, the center is inviting, the classes are fulfilling and the center is very close to where we live - what could be better”
- “For over 2 years, I've been attending pilates mat, reformer quartets, and jazz dance classes at Animas. They even offer clases for special needs kids. The teachers are patient and explain how to do the exercises with care and options for different levels of strength. They are very thorough and handle any concerns with attentiveness and respect. Animas is my sanctuary away from the outer world that prevents back pain I fomerly had.”
- “This is an amazing studio for yoga, dance, & pilates. There is such good energy at the Animas Center and everyone who works there exudes this. It is beloved by many loyal customers who do classes several times a week. I usually do one class a week. If my schedule allowed, I would be there as often as I could. Despite not being a frequent flier, the ladies know your name. The prices are reasonable and the teaching is excellent. They also provide free classes for special needs kids. My trainer's daughter goes there and loves it. They often do fund raisers for local charities and animal shelters.  I feel very fortunate this is so close to me! This is one local business I really appreciate. Only major complaint is that the studio is small and I like to schedule private sessions and it seems like 75% of the time I try to schedule something, no one is available.”

- “Terrible experience at animas.  I paid for private one on one sessions for Pilates and the first thing that happened is my credit card got all screwed up in the way they charged me. Not a big deal easily remedied. After making my first appointment, I get a phone call practically begging me to come in earlier because the instructor would like to get home to her children and had someone cancel. I'm nice, So, I reschedule. I go to my first session and the instructor was not very nice as if I was inconveniencing her with my inexperience. Then, I ask if there's a different instructor that I might try and they scheduled me. However, I have to be OK with a one and a half year-old in the room during my private Pilates session. Trying not to be a jerk, I say yes. They say maybe her husband could take the child maybe not. I rearrange my schedule so that I can attend the appointment and an hour and a half before the appointment I get a phone call saying it needs to be canceled. The mom that's scheduled for my session can only work two hours in a row and she's already booked for two hours. People, this is a business. I get that you have personal lives and your families come first. But, again, this is a business. I pre-paid for sessions that I would like to use one on one with an instructor. By myself, full focus on me. I ended up asking for my money back. I don't even know if it's going to happen or not I guess I just wait for someone to tell me. This place is a hot mess. And it's super disappointing because it's down the street from my house.”

Great way to start the morning! Pilates or stretch really helps. Great place!

After the bike rack was installed I had lots of help from everyone making sure I was satisfied with the installation and comfortable with the product.  This 70 year old lady hasn't experienced this overall great treatment while being a customer in a very long time. Well done!  And no, I was not asked or pestered to provide feedback - which was very much appreciated. Thank you!”
- “Awesome service and a big thank you to Alex, the store manager. He spent a great deal of time trying to make what I wanted work, but in the end we could not put it together. He was helpful and courteous all the while, and when no deal could be done, that was OK too. I am now a customer for life.”

- “Purchased some Aries action trac steps for my Ford pick up for 2k and had multiple issues with them within the year or so since . One either quits retracting into the actual step or gets stuck, this is the 2nd time this has happened and supposed to be under warranty! Months and months have gone where I had to call for an update  as to where the hell these pieces of craps are ? When I first took the truck in Alex said they'd be replaced no problem but they're in North Dakota or some crap and COVID will delay shipping , I bought it and left it is now June 11th and this was in February so are they making these new ones from scratch? Shitty communication and no call backs, between me and my old man we've spent quite a bit of money at this place but the hell with them now thanks "quality bumper" !”
- “We had a Bedrug installed here today on our F-250. It looks like total ass with gaps all over the place. Avoid this place like the plague if you want a quality install. We decided on Quality Bumper as they were one of the few authorized installers in Tucson and are very disappointed.”

That day came today and Ramon walked me through every step of the way with patience, kindness, and care!   The gorgeous flowers were delivered within three hours of my phone call. They even sent me a photo of the arrangement ahead of time -- and let me make a last-minute change to the card!  Thank you Ramon and Forget Me Nots!”

- “I had a wonderful experience with this florist. I live on the other side of the country and wanted to send something amazing to my friend who just moved (so, new florist) on the anniversary of her close relative's passing. I called and found out that, yes, they were open during the pandemic (other florists were not doing regular deliveries or were hard to get a hold of). I got to speak with the owner, who was extremely friendly and easy to communicate with.  I had looked at arrangements on the website and wanted to send something customized, using a few of the arrangements as guides since we could not be in person. I gave a budget and we went over my ideas. It was extremely easy and I was NEVER pressured during the process!  This is all great, but if the end result isn't satisfactory, what's it all for? I'm pleased to say the results exceeded expectations. Desi listened to EVERY single request and the recipient was floored. She said it was the most beautiful arrangement she'd ever received, and that's saying a lot! Extras I had were to add floral glitter and some trinkets/beads/things she could decorate other stuff with later, along with a small stuffed animal for her new baby. My friend was so pleased and excited she sent several videos of her baby being enamored with the gorgeous arrangement. It brought a bit of joy to an otherwise sad day for the family, which was the entire point of the arrangement.  I was offered at several points to have a picture of the arrangement sent, especially being custom, and that was a very professional suggestion. If you aren't sure you'll like something, ask to see it and avoid miscommunications or disappointment.   Lastly, I want to add that delivery was super quick, on time and extremely professional. I will definitely be using this florist again.”

- “Extremely disappointed with the two sympathy floral arrangements ordered for my parents for the loss of a family member; one of them being premium; certainly not worth the $135.46 charge for the first arrangement, which includes tax ,delivery charge, and tip.   The name of the shop is deceiving, as it lacks quality. As a professional floral designer myself from the Los Angeles area, I am extremely dissatisfied with the quality of work and the lack of follow-through. This shop certainly lacks integrity. At a minimum, inform the buyer the arrangements lacks the flowers included in the picture.  The First arrangement ordered included: white tulips, roses, gerber daisies, stock, ranunculus, and silver leaves of cineraria in a short cylinder vase with a ribbon around.  What was received was a standard (distasteful) arrangement, certainly not worth the premium charge, with lemon leaves, carnations, off-white roses, blue delphiniums (which were not in the original order), stock, and some cushion pom pom.  The Second arrangement ordered included: white roses, tulips, stock, leather, white stargazer lilies,  and silver leaves of cineraria in a short cylinder vase.   What was received was a standardized (distasteful) arrangement with white roses, leather, stock (two measly stems) and baby's breath.  Highly suggest you order elsewhere!!! These arrangements looked like left over arrangements from Mother's Day that fell off the delivery truck!”
- “Called and no answer on phone and no sign on door. They were closed. Took my business elsewhere and added them to our local 'do not use' at my workplace”
- “Do not order flowers from them. I picked an arrangement from a photo that they had online, "The Town and Country". The arrangement they sent looked nothing like it, it full of different colors of carnations.”

- “USAA, my insurance company, recommended that I use them to repair my home after mold remediation.  They did a really nice job.  Super easy to work with, not a bit of argument on anything, and willing to come back and fix anything that they didn't do right the first time.  I didn't need to ask them for that, though, since they did everything right the first time.  Their employees went the extra mile on everything: just very cooperative.  With other contractors I've often had problems with the super-nice sales person who made the "pitch," being replaced by actual site workers with negative attitudes and poor cooperation skills.  Not so with BWS.  They had a job-site manager who could be reached at any time over the phone, but who also came out to my house several times just to make sure everything was going perfectly.  That was AWESOME!  They also cleaned up after themselves really well. I really recommend these guys.”
- “We had a leak under our kitchen sink that damaged several cabinets. Better Way Services (BWS) is one of the preferred companies our insurance company suggested, and we are not disappointed that we chose them. The water mitigation process was good and pretty quick.  We decided to change up the kitchen layout for the rebuilding process, and BWS came through better than expected!  The quality of materials and installation was fantastic. The only negative in the whole ordeal was a miscommunication on a delay in the schedule, but it was easily corrected.  We hope to not have another claim, but if we do, BWS will be our first choice.”
- “This company is amazing.  I have used them twice with terrific results.  First time, part of my home was flooded from a broken pipe.  Second time, last week, we suffered through a devastating home invasion when 2 doors were kicked in.  Todd took my call at 7:00 am and immediately went to the home and secured it by screwing the doors shut.  Don was assigned to do our work which included installing 2 new doors, trim work, and paint.  I can't say enough great things about this company.  Not only do they complete the work in a timely and professional manner, they are great at holding your hand during a difficult and stressful situation.  Thanks guys!  You are all amazing and I won't hesitate to call you in the future.”

- “There was a leak from my roof into my living room near the chimney. We called to have Better Way come out to do an estimate. Kent and Nacho came out on time when they said they would. After checking the roof, they left. My wife took the trash out and noticed our hinged downspout was flattened on the end outside the side of our house. This is where Kent and Nacho were parked during the estimate visit and where they put their ladder to get on the roof. She texted the photo and I contacted Amanda at Better Way and explained the situation. I asked if they would fix this 10' foot downspout. She explained Kent was a nice person and would fix it if he did it. She requested a photo and I sent it via text to her. Later, she contacted Kent and texted to me that he noticed it when he arrived and sent her a picture of the damage which he confidently denied doing it. I have photos of the hinged downspout, their tire tracks, and their business card. Amanda notified me to contact Kent for further questions. I spoke with Kent on the phone and asked what he noticed and why he took a picture. He explained he thought it was strange how it looked and thought to take a picture to discuss it with others later. When asked why he thought it was strange, he thought we were watering the prickly pear cactus next to it. I told him that was not the purpose as it helps keep water out from the house and away from the foundation. I have one in the back of my house for the same reason. Not sure why we would water the prickly pear, and if so, push the water so far away from it, outside the planter. I asked why he didn't notify my wife of the damage, he hesitated and then said they notice strange things and talk about it later. But then I asked where he was parked and he said the driveway. I told him my wife said he was parked on the side of the house and that is where they climbed up to the roof. Kent got defensive and raised his voice to talk over me. I explained if he did not do it then he could have told us and it was fine. He said my wife was incorrect and that he parked in the driveway. I asked him if he was near the gutter and he kept repeating he was not near it. My wife witnessed where they parked and the tire tracks are there next to it and on the flattened part of the downspout. He refused to fix it and called my wife a liar. We had no one else at the house for some time and there are no tracks in front of the house only on the side. Kent then changed his story about the pic and said he took it because of people like me who accuse him of things like this. He said he did it to cover himself.  It seems dishonest to take a picture of something he was not there for and not say anything about the damage.Then he changed the reason for taking a picture twice in a phone call asking about it. I called them out to give them my business and they damage my property. Then they accuse me of damaging it and trying to get them to fix it. While this is a part I had to order , it is not worth lying about it and going out of my way to get someone to pay for it. Is this how an honest business works? Have they done this before and this is how they get out of it? Are all customers in the wrong when Better Way damages something? They changed their story about the pic twice and their first explanation is not plausible. Is this the kind of business the customers deserve in Tucson?”
- “We needed our bathroom rebuilt from a leak that started in September. We started working with Better Way in October. It took several months to get anything started, partially because our insurance company was being unresponsive. While this isn't Better Way's fault, they didn't update us on any of the delays, so it took months for us to even start the rebuild process. I asked multiple times to get the rebuild scheduled and they refused. When we finally got scheduled for a contractor to start work, they no-showed on us three different times. Some of these appointments were sprung on us the night before, causing us to cancel plans to fit them in. Completely clueless. We took our deposit and will have to start again elsewhere. Thanks for delaying our bathroom rebuild by several months.”

- “This is one of my favorite restaurants in Tucson. Every dish is always perfect. They have a large selection of vegan items. The help is always pleasant and the place is always clean.”
- “I have been coming to Guilin for a very long time.  I have always enjoyed the food:  Fried Tofu w/ Spiced Salt is my all time favorite.  I enjoy the staff very much.  The new location seems to have some new staff.  The new staff are welcomed because they seem to help move the restaurant to that next level.  I manage a restaurant just down the street from the new location and welcome the owners and staff to the area.  At the new location the food is still incredibly good, fast, and delivered with precision.  The pluses are the location and the new building.”
- “The lunch specials starting at $4.99 are going to keep me coming back to Guilin's. At local competitors, you will pay about $5.99-$6.99 for the same lunch. I will choose this over a fast food place any day. I have been here several times, and the food and service have been consistently pleasant. They give you a choice of brown rice or fried rice for no extra charge. Moreover, there's a wide range of dishes available on their lunch menu, including vegan options. My favorite lunch special so far has been the tomato beef. Although it doesn't have the "eggs" like some traditional Cantonese recipes, it is nevertheless a great bargain and tastes delicious.”

- “The food looked appetizing, and the prices are reasonable, but the dishes smell like a wet dog! It's all because they need to clean their dishwasher, such a simple solution to a simple problem. Other people have taken notice of this, and yet no change has been made! Why on Earth would you continue to let your dishes smell so horrible???”
- “Horrible salty rice noodles with vegetables. Minimal vegetable portion, a few pieces of broccoli. If it was "eat in "as before Covid that dish wouldn't have a chance on my table.  The chef would be asked to make a new dish for me.  I'm disappointed because we have had very tasty meals before at Guilin.  My husbands Mongolian beef was very over salted as well,although a nice dish.”
- “Was not impressed with the food or the service.   The General Tso's chicken lacked spice,  was overly sweet, and was not what I have come to expect as a General Tso's chicken dish.   The lo-mein was lacking in flavor.  The staff is not attentive to the customer.”

## Tips from customers

- “Years ago I called Arizona Electric to upgrade the wiring in my Tucson home so I could put in an electrical stovetop when remodeling the kitchen of my house on E. Alta Vista that was built in 1967. He also replaced a couple of burned out electrical outlets.  John was busy and we had to wait a couple days but he was worth the wait! These guys are very service oriented and know what they are doing. I learned the hard way after having a bad experience with a supposed licensed contractor from Craigslist. Arizona Electric is professional! I will always go back to them if in need of future work!  John - at one point - had recommended the owners brother to do some interior work and he spilled varnish all over the garage floor. I was very unhappy with that recommendation and paid the guy he sent less money because of the damage from the varnish that could not be removed.  John is such a kind guy he went ahead and paid the brother of the owner the rest of the invoice even though as a subcontractor he did not deserve it. I respect that he works to do good by everyone. And he certainly is a knowledgeable electrician! You pay more but you get more! Call them.”

Abrupt, scowling attitude at inspections, doesn't handle questions well - short, perfunctory responses to emails - discussed specific work in person at inspection, then it's not on work order, technicians drive extra ground rods in when there's clearly an old one outside that they admitted could've been used instead of paying for new ones - but they claim not to have seen it, although it's a foot away from the one they installed - when Will is questioned about specific work discussed in an effort to add it to work order, abruptly CANCELS ENTIRE JOB VIA EMAIL rather than call to discuss. Wow - very unprofessional, beware.”

- “Jake Etchart came out to fix a leaky hot water heater and he was fantastic.  Luckily our problem was a pretty quick fix, but he didn't just fix the leak and rush off.  He definitely exceeded our expectations when he cleared away several containers stored in the area that was flooded, and vacuumed up all the water.  He then told us what to do to ensure we didn't get any mold buildup, and even shared some much needed info about the reason why we are suddenly having terrible hard water stains on all our dishes and silverware when using the dishwasher.  Did you know that the substance that typically takes care of hard water stains has been removed from dishwashing soaps? Apparently it's a new law.  So Jake said there are a lot of folks having the same issue.   AND of course, he had the professional strength stuff we needed to take care of that problem as well.    It's always such a pleasure to receive excellent customer service, and when you get someone who cares about your experience, readily shares all they know about the issue, and takes the time to get the job done properly, it certainly makes your day.  Great experience!!”

- “They might be good, but be sure to watch out for sneaky pricing/billing practices.  Their estimate/quote won't include the "service fee" and it's not rolled into the bill if you choose to go with them. If the plumber says something like "There's always a service fee," then tell him/her there's always a door and don't let it hit you in the butt on your way out.”
- “These folks installed the original water heater when the house was built. When it died, 12 years later, I called them first because of that fact, reasoning they'd be familiar with the set up. I sent them an email on their website stating exactly what I had and what I needed to replace it. Three days later, while the unit was still in its death throes, they left me a voicemail asking me to call them. About a week later, when it finally stopped working, I called again. No one answered but a message told me to leave my name and number (which they already had) and they'd get back to me. An hour later I called again and, once again, no one answered. I'm not sure how they stay in business without anyone bothering to follow up on inquiries because it certainly is NOT their customer service. I wouldn't buy a squirt gun from this outfit.”

- “Don't play with your health! Many products are expired or close to the expiration date. Overpriced. Unsanitary conditions. Food storage conditions are not met.”
- “First of all, I have a couple of questions: 1. Are those who have previously written reviews still alive after eating in this establishment? 2. How does it stay in business?  I really looked forward to my visit to this place, mostly based on the pictures from the net and cravings for some tasty salamis (which are so good elsewhere). Well, I do not know what on Earth can bring me back! The place looks nice but WHAT A TERRIBLE STINK INSIDE. The store screams "I'm a Waste Management long forgotten pick-up site". They have a rather poor selection of meats/salamis/dairy products, maybe if it was cheap ... but it's absolutely not. I've been to a similar store in a south-eastern city twice as small as Tucson and their prices are so reasonable and despite the heat they managed to keep their products fresh and nice looking. Here my favorite salamis were separated from their greasy wrapping, as well as the rest of the stuff was covered in a greasy dust. If I had pigs I would have never made them eat in there. All the groceries look (and smell, for this matter) as if they were thrown away from a Soviet era bomb shelter which is not far from a reality, I guess, but to keep them honest they should have come up with a different name for the store. Oh, one good thing, there is a nice selection of Russian/Czech beers - for almost $4.00 per bottle. The bottom line: if anyone has ever been so unfortunate as to go to the yuckiest Russian bathroom - congratulations! - there are worst places out there!”
- “I will NOT patronize this place EVER. So, I drove by and saw European market and gyros & I turned around and pulled in. I walked in and saw a menu that said Eastern European and got really excited. They had cabbage rolls (sarma) so I felt like I was in the right place. THEN, The woman at the counter who started to wait on me was wearing a trump mask. A TRUMP MASK. Well, that's one way in Tucson to lose customers or not gain new ones, which I would've been. They could've had a new customer who would've told everyone they knew about this market, but because she felt it necessary to wear a political mask in her business, I will never be a customer. Not just any political mask, but one that represents hate and racism. If it was any other mask, it would've been fine. It could've been any Republican mask, but not this one. That one act showed me exactly what kind of person she is and I will never patronize her business, ever.”

## Tips from customers
Best Gyros you'll find in Tucson. Great food great service. The address on here will take you to a trailer park. Just plug it in to your GPS Place is a great hidden gem. Food was delicious, very authentic! Loved my server :) Dirty glass, dirty table.  Gyro was ok Directly across the street from Pep Boys The lamb gyros are amazing! Pair a nice Russian beer with your meal and you're all set! Very good service and they offer excellent products from Easter Europe.

The drop off is usually seamless, although some employees are better than others in this area. Sometimes I get help unloading sometimes not....But the treasures inside compensate.”

- “My friend and I came over to this part of town to have lunch at the new Lindy's and do some thrifting on 50% off day. I had no idea there was a Goodwill here, so it worked out perfectly.   This may be my favorite Goodwill in town. And this is after my FIRST VISIT. And on the same day as the 50% sale to boot.   The selection, even picked over in the late afternoon, was pretty good. Some very helpful person had left empty CD cases on top of the shelves (to whoever they are, let me say you are the real MVP because I would have bought all of those without checking.) But even with the empty cases, there was still some good stuff. I got "Left of The Middle" by Natalie Imbruglia and "Relish" by Joan Osborne. (I graduated in '97. This is the soundtrack of my teen years.)  The book selection is HUGE! I was so excited to find plenty of stuff I was interested in reading - including a nearly new copy of one of my favorite books of the past few years, "The Interestings" by Meg Wolitzer. But most importantly, I found a book I've wanted for years - "Anne Sexton: A Self Portrait In Letters".   I don't see myself going back to this Goodwill on a regular basis as there is one very close to where I live, but I highly recommend checking this one out if you're in the area.   Who knows what kind of wonderful treasures you might be able to find?”

- “Horrible experience there. The assistant was rude, incompetent and inconsiderate of both the dog and my wife who took the dog in. The assistant told the doctor the dog, who was in my wife's arms, bit her which he did not. And she said my wife hit her which most certainly did not happen. The doctor told the assistant to step aside. The doctor wanted to take Marley, our dog into the exam room (without my wife) but by this time the dog and my wife were so traumatized that she just walked out. I recommended strongly against this vet because they would have an employee like this one.”

They took care of everything and made selling our house painless. I have dealt with many realtors and these two are absolutely the best! HIGHLY RECOMMEND.”
- “We knew Rob and Catherine because they live in our old neighborhood, and we know they have a vested interest in maintaining the quality and housing values of the neighborhood. We are so glad we hired them - they got us full price on our home, gave us great advice, and were very communicative. Both very pleasant people to work with, and very personable. We would definitely recommend Catherine and Rob Hallberg.”
- “These realtors, especially Rob as he's the one I primarily dealt with, were very good and I would certainly recommend them as a potential buyer.  I was from out of state (Texas) considering a move to Arizona, where I had previously lived.  I saw other good reviews of Rob and Catherine, so I contacted them, and was thereafter sent many good prospects to consider.  Rob was excellent in zeroing in on just what I was seeking, and very diligent when I made changes or wanted to tweak something.  Communication with him was wonderful, and he always responded very quickly and addressed all concerns.  He was also more than willing to make time in his schedule to show me appropriate properties, had I come out.  In the end, I opted to stay in Texas for medical reasons, however, it's very possible I will make a future move to Arizona - and I intend to contact Rob again for his help.  Thanks, Rob!”

- “My husband and I chose Rob and Catherine as the listing agents for our home. Much of the service they provided was favorable, but we also had some serious complaints.   The good: - They hired a professional photographer to take quality photos of our home.  - Our home was listed in a timely manner. - Our home was well represented in a variety of online sources. - They ordered quality full color business cards that showcased our home and served as a great takeaway for potential buyers. - They responded very quickly to phone calls and text messages. - Our home was part of two home tours for local agents which increased our visibility and marketability. - They did an excellent job of advertising and marketing our home.  The not-so-good - They lacked expertise in pricing. During our first meeting, they suggested that my husband and I list our home for $400,000. We thought that was significantly too high and so I asked Rob point blank what was the lowest number he would feel comfortable listing our home for. He replied that he would not suggest listing it any lower than $400k. When it came time to list, my husband and I insisted on listing at $369k. The home eventually sold for $349k. I feel that listing it too high initially had a negative effect on our final sale price and I wish we had been given a more accurate listing price from the start. - They lacked expertise in negotiating. We received two offers in one weekend, approximately six weeks after our home was listed. My husband and I felt that Rob and Catherine should have used the competing offers to our advantage in order to secure for us the highest possible sale price. They did not do so despite our explicit request.  - Our best interests were not their top priority. Once we had accepted an offer, Rob and Catherine seemed to "switch sides". The buyer made one specific request that would have been detrimental to our interests. In response, my husband and I pressed Rob for further information, requesting he talk to the buyer's agent to better understand why the buyer was making the request. Rob resisted and lobbied my husband and I to concede on the issue stating that the deal might fall through if we didn't. Eventually my husband called the buyer's agent directly in order to completely bypass Rob and Catherine because we felt as though their top priority was simply to close the deal without regard to our best interests and getting us top dollar for our home. This happened within the first ten days of getting an accepted offer. From that point forward, we completely worked directly with the buyer ourselves because that was the only way we could trust that our best interests were being represented. We did not end up conceding to the buyer's request on that one issue and the home did indeed close successfully.  Unfortunately, we do not believe that we obtained top dollar for our home or that Rob and Catherine were concerned with our best interests.  Everything considered, my husband and I could not--in good faith--recommend Rob and Catherine to someone looking to sell a home. They might be fine as a buyer's agent but given their lack of negotiating skills and willingness to concede to a buyer's every whim without even understanding the buyer's motivation, they are a detriment to a homeowner who wishes to obtain top dollar for his or her home. To be fair, I will say that they were very competent in marketing our home and seeing us through the listing process. That competency went out the window as soon as we had an offer. I recommend looking elsewhere for an agent who will put your interests at the top of his or her priority list and will expertly negotiate on your behalf. That, by definition, is what an agent is for.”

- “From the moment I walked in just a few days ago, I knew immediately that this was going to be my favorite gun store in Tucson. I was greeted by Oscar who is professional, knowledgeable and very personable. Next I met Brandon the owner and was blown away by his knowledge base and his friendly demeanor. These guys are the nicest people I've met in the firearm business period. In the past, the most I could hope for was maybe one or two employees at a given gun store would be helpful and kind. At the HUB everyone has a great personality and is genuinely interested in getting to know you. They were so welcoming I found myself becoming interested in the newer AR 15 rifles that are out these days. They provided me with such good information and in such a pleasant manner I found myself planning a purchase. 3 days later I purchased one of the most advanced rifles I've ever owned and added some really nice accessories. Jason even put the accessories on my brand new rifle for me right there so I wouldn't have to worry about installation.   They have a huge selection of firearms and accessories. Probably the largest Sig Sauer display I've ever seen in a store. They also hold classes and have a shooting simulator to practice with. They're opening an actual shooting range next year to compliment their classes and accommodate their customers.   I look forward to more wonderful customer service experiences from these professionals. They're soon to become known as the go to place for all your firearm needs. And do you know why? They're really nice people, and at the end of the day that's what people remember t”
- “A great place for all your firearm needs. The store is well stocked, and it's an attractive store (hey I'm a girl we notice those things), Paul is a great instructor. I was comfortable with him from the moment I met him. His instructions were clear and he's just a real nice person.”
- “I am new to shooting, so I wanted to make sure I get trained, gun safety and importance of gun ownership. So I decided to sign up for a personal training session and the class was beyond what I expected. Paul was my instructor, he took the time explain everything. When I had questions he stop and explain a made sure that I understood and was comfortable to move on to the next item.  We had time to shoot the gun in the range and he took time to show me how to shoot.  He made sure to explain where and how my finger placement on the gun was important. We did some drills and target practice as well.  I even got picture and a video! I would definitely go back to the HUB to take more classes and purchase more items from there as well.”

- “Terrrrrrible customer service. I found myself at the counter waiting to be assisted as I was ready to walk out of the store with a new EDC. All I received was a reluctant "how are you?" I waited a little over 20 minutes watching and waiting to be approached by one of the three workers behind the counter. I even had enough time to call SNG Tactical down the street to check their inventory. After finding out SNG had the same exact firearm The Hub was carrying, I decided to take my business to SNG where I was assisted almost immediately.  Response to owner: Incident occurred on 01/06/2021.”
- “Went in to purchase some ammo.  Gentleman in the red hoodie behind the counter seemed less than highly motivated.  9mm is LEO only, no OC spray in stock, ignored my request about 223 ammo.  Apparently this business doesn't need to sell anything.”
- “Walked out of here and went right over to another gun store and spent $1k on a new gun and accessories. The big dark haired guy behind the counter that helped me was rude, arrogant and sarcastic. Everything I asked him was met with nothing more than grunts and shoulder shrugs and sarcastic responses. I'm not the gun expert people, you are supposed to be. Sell me a gun by what I'm telling you, or at least suggest something. Worst customer service imaginable and not sure why he would talk to me like I'm 7 years old and constantly looking over me like I was bothering him. Next stop a few miles away sold me within minutes. Funniest part was I ran into a guy that had just walked out of the Hub right before I was helped. He was buying too. Coincidence? I don't think so.”

- “Janet is an amazing artist.  She redid my eyebrows which were not done well at another salon.  The color and shape are just perfect.  On my next visit, I had my upper eyeliner done.  I was so nervous about it, but I felt absolutely no pain at all, and I just love the liner.  It is absolutely perfect.  Janet is a perfectionist and her works shows it.  She asks if you have any pain, and I had no pain whatsoever.  She has the most wonderful calming personality, you almost fall asleep while she is working on you.  Janet's prices are very reasonable, and she does one free touch-up.  If you want permanent makeup in the Tucson area, I highly recommend Janet at Lily Anesthetics.  And she has the cutest dogs ever!”
- “I researched through yelp for best permanent make-up places and I found Janet. And all they said was true. Janet is very accurate, attentive, and makes amazing job. I have different eye-brows, lost a hair cuz of thyroid problems, so I needed a professional special person for precise make-up. And for eyes make up, I wanted something special too, to emphasize my Asianish features. It took us some time to draw a correct lines and then to complete it in permanent color. Janet is extremely patient for my needs and does everything possible to meet the expectations of her customer. She has a good sense of art and lines in such small areas. It's like a jeweler's job. Janet also reapplied a naming cream, so procedure wasn't painful at next touches. Thank you, Janet! :) I'm satisfied with my looks now. I'll come back for touch ups, and will keep coming to Janet in few years.”
- “Derma rolling anyone.  Janet at Lily Aesthetics is amazing.  My skin glows, pores tighter and all because of the expertise that Janet provides.  SO SO Happy I found her!!”

- “I took my mother for her eyebrows and was relatively happy. I then bought  the lip tat for my mother and she had a very very bad reaction. I called Janet and it took her a while to get back to me. I called her a second time to see if her reaction was normal. Her lips blew up freakishly, about 5 times their normal size. Janet said that was normal and to just ice it. She never asked to see her or anything. About 2 days later, my mother got blisters. I think it was because her lips swelled and burst. I called Janet before our follow up to cancel. I told her that my mother had the blisters for a while and she said that my mother had herpes and that the tat had brought the herpes out. I asked her for a refund of some sort since we were canceling because of her reaction and Janet said no. She was very snarky and said that my mother needs herpes medication.   I think 1) Janet should have been clear about the potential for blisters if someone has the herpes complex (cold sores). Although I think the blister developed because her lips burst. She doesn't get cold sores; didn't before and hasn't since.  2) since we could not do the second part of the service, Janet should have refunded half our payment. It was only fair and I feel like she got to keep all the money for half the work on top of the fact that my poor mother suffered tremendously during 3 weeks.”

- “My first time at Salon De Nouveau and I am sold! I was in town visiting my boyfriend's family and needed to stop in for some highlights. Danielle was absolutely amazing! She did a combo of regular highlights and balayage and the effect was astounding. My hair has never looked better, even after paying twice the price for highlights in Seattle, so CHECK HER OUT! The salon is super professional and I even got a new client gift bag after my appointment! They really know how to make you feel special here, and i left feeling rejuvenated and beautiful!”
- “I love Janice. She is so creative with nail art. She is friendly  and courteous.  Best place for sculptured acrylics!!”
- “Love love love my hair stylist here. Eric is the best. As you can read on my other reviews I have been through 12 stylists in the Prescott area. None can cut my hair like Eric. So I drive the 3 1/2 hours if I want a great cut and it's well worth it.”

- “Hate to do this. I had high hopes for this salon. It's on my way home from work and looks great inside and out.  I asked for a trim - and color - the trim was the equivalent of a bang trim and yet I was charged full pop. The color was a nightmare - it was garish, harsh and one dimensional, not the subtle highlights discussed. Total bill - a few hundred dollars to look worse than when I walked in.  I know they give new clients the new stylists and they often aren't the best but to charge me a senior stylist's rates and then not reduce the bill at all for the obvious disaster on my head was just classless.   Honestly, I would have returned had they not charged for the trim or taken a few dollars off the color - I wanted to like this place. I'm new to town and I need a salon. And it's very nice inside - upscale, nicely decorated, relaxing. But now, I'd never go again.”
- “If I could give them less than 1 star...I would. Went in for a body perm and came out way too curly.  I could deal with that because it will relax, but the cut that she gave me is horrible! All I can do with it is pull it back in a pony and even that looks bad. Very disappointed!!!!!!”
- “Was going to give 2 stars but looked at my hair & now I'm mad again......I went in with the light lavender photo for reference & had, unfortunately, a short time frame for them to accommodate. They insisted that they could produce the image requested as well as work with my timeframe. When I went in at 3:15pm, Susana did my double highlights and color. I was given the light "lilac" color that was barely tinted & looked more pink than lavender. I finished the appointment around 8-8:30pm & was FUMING so instead of going home pissed & posting a bad review, I decided to go back in & ask the manager what the heck happened & if they could fix it & ended up in the salon until 10pm & walked out with the final, VERY DARK version of what I was promised. Again, they were so kind & they did "their best" to fix it but overall if you're doing crazy colors, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!! That's a huge $270 down the drain for me to have to fix it in about 1-2 weeks. Even highlights/root touch ups are done half hearted. Always reference the negative ratings with the good so you're not blind sighted.”

Alyssa does the best brows in town! My pedicure was great but service was not. I felt uncomfortable and rushed.

- “Jim is excellent. I couldn't ask for a better person working on my car. He is friendly, sincere, knowledgeable, and I really trust what he says and does regarding my vehicle. As a young woman, I have taken my car to many places where I've felt (or been told afterwards) that I was being taken advantage of or made fun of for my lack of knowledge. I've never felt anything like this from Jim. He really listens to what I want, explains what needs to be done in layman's terms, and tells me about the different options of what to do, when to do it, and how much it will cost. I recommend Quantum Mechanics and Jim Mabry to anyone and everyone.”
- “didnt have much time and got told a few different things from other mechanics and brought it here cause of other reviews and I was very impressed, he was so helpful and took the time on my vehical and was honest with me which is appreciiated extremely problem fixed within a few hours and not expensive and its a piece of mind to know my suv is in good shape and in good hands if I ever need any work done again big to small doesnt matter Ill be coming here, even driving 45 mins just to go here is well worth it”
- “I have had my car there, and my daughter had the same car there after I gave it to her. Jim treats us kindly and professionally. We don't know much about car repair, and appreciate when he tells us what we could do vs. what we really should do. Then we can make an educated decision.”

I got an appointment and price estimate and came on time on my weekend (even with bad weather)  .. but he "DECLINED" to do the work - I was shocked beyond words -  because as he put it;  "his clients"  trust him and dont ask how much it costs ahead of time !!! He wants an Open Check .. and only Stupid  FOOLS should go to him ... unless you are a white dude or dame .. then he will take care of you .. else ; you may be charged double .. just to make sure you never go back again. WATCH OUT !!!   JIM MAYBRY's screwed-up understanding of bussiness is ; 1- come Drop off your car , 2- i do ALL the work I think it needs ( not what you may think it needs or want done); 3- then I ask you to pay me all that I decide I want to charge ( and don't you dare question that - cause I am an honest person), 4- and You SHOULD be Happy and Thankful .. that I agreed to work on your car !!! The guy needs a Psychiatrist- TO FIX HIS SICK BRAIN  !!!    This may work for old friends or existing clients .. but most certainly not for an out-of-State NEW client. READ HIS REVIEWS ON GOOGLE TOO !!!! MANY HAD SAME EXPERIENCE.”

- “I found them from an AZ Star article where the owners weren't at all upset about the rising minimum wage. "If we lose customers because our rates go up, we'll find new customers."  They did, in ME, and I'm glad.  The same crew comes every month.  They love the plants the way I love the plants.  They pruned my trees perfectly (I've had Master Gardener training in 2 states; I know what butchered trees look like) and that's no small feat.  They are proactive when problems arise.  They are willing to reschedule if I need it, or to skip a month if I don't.    There's never an excuse - they always show up.”
- “Danny and the guys do a great and thorough job. We have had them out 4-5 times and there are no complaints. Highly suggested”
- “They did an amazing job cleaning up my trees,  cactus,  bushes etc. Five stars isn't enough.  If you're looking for someone to come and take care of your yard before your trees are knocked down by the monsoon winds, call these guys!  We've had so many bad landscapers who do a "half-assed job" (quoting my father here), it was wonderful having someone who had reasonable rates and did a FANTASTIC job. Thank you McBride Landscaping.  You guys rock and I will post repetitively on social media. They should get all the customers!”

- “So my husband and I came here around 10:00 am with the drive-thru line mildly busy. This is our first time trying this place as we are from Cali. We were helped by Noah and he was super helpful. He made our first experience great. We gave him the question of, "What's good here?" and he gave us a run-through of what is good here based on our typical drinks we order. He gave us options on what we can do to our drinks and was so eager to help us get drinks that would be super good for us. He suggested the Cinnamon Swirl Oatmilk Latte and the Golden Eagle and they were freaking delicious. I also want to comment that Noah and his fellow coworkers have amazing energy in the morning. They were so happy to work and had smiles on their faces. Love their vibe.”

- “Went back yesterday for one of the (recurring) Sunday Game Days.  The shop looks amazing, and is now fully stocked with anything and everything you might want to purchase from a game store. (And if you are looking for something they don't have, just ask -- they can order it and/or let you know when it's back in print)  One thing i didn't realize untill yesterday is that the spacious back play area (with the 8+ tables) isn't only open during the Sunday Game Days (and "Friday Night Magic") events that they organize.  Drew & the rest of the staff encourage people to come in anytime they're open and hang out and play games -- either from the impressive library of games to try, or games you might bring from home (even if you didn't buy them at the store).”
- “When I go to game stores I'm usually greeted with a knowledgeable clerk who takes one look at me and pours out condescending comments. Making me feel awkward and out of place. I am not a true gamer nor knowledgeable enough to be at their level. I know this about myself. I don't even try, lol.  BUT I DO enjoy some games and indulge in a few fun purchases here and there. I never know if I like something until I try it. So that's what brings me to these game stores.  But when I walked into this store I was greeted by a very nice clerk who didn't dismiss me even tho I told him that I'm not a true gamer. He took his time with me, showed me around and even showed me the daily game schedule.  This was probably the nicest experience I've ever had at a game store.  I will be back! And I totally recommend you going as well, regardless of your gaming experience or knowledge!!”
- “Isle of Games is the best table-top game store in Tucson.  From board games, card games and role-playing games, to puzzles and toys for my daughter, this is where I go to buy all things game-related. And to buy those game-related things, I drive for 30 minutes, past 7 other game stores to get to Isle. It's just that much better!  What makes Isle the best (among admittedly other great gaming stores in Tucson) is the unrivaled customer service, top to bottom cleanliness without the normal gamer-funk that other stores are afflicted with, competitive prices with a 10% back reward program, and a family-friendly environment that is strictly (but politely) enforced.  When you enter the store, you'll be greeted by one of the two managers, Drew or Ben, or the store owner, Gordon (the owner has a very active presence in the store). The first thing you'll notice is that the store feels different from other gaming stores you might have previously visited. Most significantly, there will be no smell!  But just as important, the environment is welcoming to ALL people, unlike the intimidating "ultra-gamer" feel that other stores cater to in the area. And don't get me wrong... I'm probably in the category of being an "ultra-gamer" with over 425+ board games in my collection and two 7-foot tall bookshelves filled with RPG's... but I like to think of myself as a bit more of a refined ultra-gamer, and I despise the typical game stores that have that "ultra-gamer" arrogance and intimidation to them. Isle is not intimidating or awkward to shop in like those other stores; therefore, it's the best place in Tucson for new players to be welcomed to the community, or for a family to have their weekly game night.  For the "ultra-gamers" out there, like me, Isle has something for you, too. Drew is the best at obtaining hard-to-find, rare, and awesome promo items. And he hosts weekly events, tournaments, and demos for you to earn or win them for free! Now, like me, Isle has attracted other, more refined "ultra-gamers" and game-designers, so those tournaments wont be a walk in the park. Fortunately, Drew often has plenty of promos to go around, and I've never walked away empty-handed. And if you need a board game that is not in-stock (which is rare, because Isle has the best selection of all the other game stores in Tucson combined), Drew will get it to his store for you in about 2 days, at no extra charge. I've ordered some obscure things from Drew, from custom-sized card sleeves, wooden organizers to replace the board game inserts, custom component upgrades, limited edition game releases, rare dice... you name it, I've probably had Drew special order it, and every experience has been great. If you're looking to finance that new game by selling a few old ones, Isle has a program that will buy your used games for store credit, and will usually beat Bookman's offers.  If this sounds like the game store for you, come down and give it a try!”

- “Just started coming here a month ago and I'm really loving it. They have a variety of choices for everyone. You can get a 'frilly' sweet drink or a really strong plain dark roast, there's even teas. This is a drastic change from the typical starbucks. I love the people who go here it really sets the vibe. The staff is great too. I've been getting a tai iced coffee with a extra shot, this is a perfect in between of something sweet and strong. Also the breast milk ( yes that's what it's called) is really good too especially if you want something really sweet. It's worth giving it a try!”

The cold brew coffee had great flavor at a low price.  The atmosphere seemed like it was very chill, with a lot of students studying and others engaged in conversations.

- “I've been really excited to try this place! I scheduled a dissertation interview here for 8 am, which I thought would be no problem, because the posted hours state that they're open at 8.    I arrive there at 8, and my interviewee is sitting in the parking lot, because there's not a soul in the place-- not only is the place not unlocked, but no one is setting up or getting the coffee machines going, and there's no cars or bikes out front.   No sign on the door about changed hours.  We waited for awhile, and then decided to relocate.  By the time we figured out where to go and got set up, I had to cut my interview short and my interviewee started her day running late.   I'm 100% for local places, but please stick to your posted hours, folks...sometimes people are counting on them.”
- “No AC and using fans in Tucson is insane! And at coffee place when it's over 100 degrees.... We walked in and after a few minutes walked out. Going to another coffee place where we can chill.”
- “I have always gone to this place to study, staff was amazing except the people I encountered today who kicked me out for not buying a drink within the 10 minutes I was there. Never have I ever been so disrespected at a place. The lady with tattoos and glasses told me I had to leave if I weren't to buy a drink right away. I tried to explain that I would buy a drink after I was done on the assignment I was on. She said she didn't care and made me leave. She was extremely rude when I was very polite and trying to explain myself. I was quietly sitting and studying while minding my own business. I have never ever had this issue with any other person and I buy something EVERYTIME I come in which has never been right away. I will not be returning.”

I never would've thought that anyone could pack and move my many thousands of dollars worth of delicate studio equipment across town and at the end I'd be wearing anything but a frown but BAM! Mark and his crew absolutely slayed this move for me. Knocked it out of the park. This crew is crucial for your next move.”
- “I waited until the day of moving to look for movers to help me with my heavy furniture, including my piano. I received many quotes and almost all charged additional for my piano or additional gas fees. I received a very reasonable flat rate quote from Mark at the last minute and he worked me into his schedule. He and his helper were on time, worked efficiently and friendly. I highly recommend them and would use them again.”

Spoke to them on move day and they said they be there at 1:00. It's now 4:00 and they never showed and don't answer their phones. Scammers. Had to find a REPUTABLE company last minute. Do not, I repeat, use these losers. Unreliable and will not be in business long the way they operate. I'd give them a  minus  0 rating if Yelp allowed it.”

- “Maternal Grandmother's carved oak table that is about 100 years old was missing the extension leaves.  Ordered 3 red oak leaves blanks from a catalog.  Needed the pins and holes drilled.  I was willing to refinish the leaves even if the edges did not match the table.  Don came out and priced the work and included routing to match the original edge, staining and doing a finish on the three leaves.  When we went to pick it up, the stain, finish, and routing matched the table perfectly.  The price was was 1/3 or what some well advertised companies quoted.  Work was completed as promised.  Would highly recommend Furniture Medic by DB.  It is easy to find once you have their driving directions.  Our GPS got us lost.”
- “Excellent repair work; contacted three other places, and no one else in town would take it on. (chair leg broke "inside" the upholstery). The result is beautiful: the chair is sturdy, the upholstery looks untouched, and the craftsmanship is superior. Plus, everyone I interacted with was friendly and professional. Take  your business here-you'll be glad you found these guys.”
- “We had a cherry coffee table that was hand made by my wife's grandfather. One of the legs had been broken off and it was showing 60 years of use and abuse. It is the only item my wife had that her grandfather had made so we decided to have it restored. They were up front about expense, but also realistic about what a similar quality piece would cost new for comparison. They also advised due to the detail and work needed that the job would take 3-4 months. I can happily say it was worth the wait and the estimate was right on for time and cost. We are extremely pleased with the result. I suspect this is the best this piece has ever looked and we love it.”

- “They refinished a few items for me.  Crazed and drips in the finish even after the second attempt.  They re-did one piece but refused to re-do the crazed top.  I now have to pay someone else to fix the problems.  They are nice people until there is a problem.  I will not be using them again.”

- “The Scented Leaf is a fantastic local spot to grab some tea. I tried the Dirty Chai and it was great, flavorful but not too sweet. I was pleasantly surprised by the drink, sometimes Chai can be overwhelmingly sugary but this one wasn't while still being incredibly tasty. Their tea sizes are also pretty generous, their small being the same size as some competitor's medium drinks which was appreciated. They had tables outside for patio seating, hand sanitizer available, and walk up ordering inside with the doors open which was nice during COVID.”

- “I had an AWFUL experience at the Scented Leaf on Friday September 1st and after I purchased my tea the male clerk who was working with me walked away and another customer pushed  me to the side after I gave the male clerk my credit card and he handed t back to me. He did NOT mention that I had to sign the iPad thing and put a tip and walked away. A lady clerk (tall brunette ) called another customer up and my signature and tip thing on the iPad were still showing but I did not realize it. The clerk  selected a tip for me and said "you had your chance" in a very rude manner. She humiliated me in front of another customer and basically was like "god what are you stupid" kind of attitude. UA students are your livelihood and I don't think that people should treat anyone that way. I haven't been there in a very long time and was just coming in to relax. I did not enjoy my tea and honestly wanted to hand it back to them .  I won't be back. Thanks for a lousy  and humiliating experience.”
- “No way this place can have rave reviews. The Chi tea Latte last week was very weakl I don't know why I ordered the scone as it had small fleas flying on the inside of the case.   ( remember me yesterday.. You saw them too!) The pies were left unwrapped n left in the case 1/4 left.  I took a sip of the Chi and tossed it. Took a bite of the soft mushy scone and tossed it...  Yes nice looking place.. Yes nice person but hey when you reach down  under the counter for un refrigerated milk..  Count me OUT... !”

## Tips from customers
Try something new. Great variety. Just a nice ambience. L Great study spot! Their endless tea service is the perfect complement to a study session or book. Not a tea connoisseur by any means, but had an incredible experience here today... Damn good tea, too! Great tea, great service, great prices. This place is a gem! The people behind the counter are super friendly and patient, the tea is yummy, and they give you GENEROUS portions of pie. I won't return to places that are stingy with their servings. This place isn't. Lovely place to take a day break and try some of the way too many--in a good kind of way--teas. For the teas on tap, refill #1 is $1 and the second refill is on the house--even if you don't stay and opt to come back later. 1 drink for $4 or 13 drinks for $20...  You do the math:). $1 refill and free second refill.  Free 5th drink reward. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Teas are good too! Lots of teas in tap! Try the fruit bomb is a mix of the mango tea, passion fruit tea, Yerba mate, etc etc. Very friendly and helpful. I had the 'dark tea' (aged in caves and blended with rose petals he said) and it was divine. They also wrote down all the best restaraunts and places to see for me which was above and beyond great tea, Wi-Fi, atmosphere is a little more mellow than across the street if you need that. Love the selection of teas and the girl who assisted was very helpful. Great little tea spot! Very nice people and the tea was amazing! Tea. Tea. Relax. Breathe. steep. Tea.  Decadent desserts. Linger over the leaves... Good seating place Great Yerba Mate and papaya Passion tea! Absolute best place on campus to hang out! A great place to study, stay cool, chat, or just relax. Try the Matcha with brown sugar and almond milk for an earthy-sweet treat (if Troy's there, his will rock your world)! love this place Nice and friendly Great selection and laid back atmosphere. Will definitely be back and tell friends! They serve a variety of different types of tea. I asked the dude at the register for milk tea and he made me his specialty! It wasn't the best, but great customer service because he adapted. I would come here again

- “Breakout has a variety of ways to get you moving! Whether you are here for dance, TRX, toning, or cardio, Breakout has the classes for you. I have regularly attended DJ Dance Cardio with Todd where the energy is contagious. You won't want to stop dancing! I recently tried Open Modern and Long and Lean and will be going back for more.  When you sign up, they will add you to a listserv and send out information about new classes, schedules, and sales. I've never paid full price for classes since I started. Follow them on social media for more information about classes and sales. Life moves - move with it!”
- “I go to Todd's class mostly. AMAZING instructor and DJ Herm's music is outstanding. I miss the f2f so much! Doing the online classes from home helps, and I'm glad for the health of their awesome instructors that they're keeping it online for now. But this is the number 1 thing I will run back to when life is back to normal.”
- “I HIGHLY recommend this fitness and dance studio. I come from a dance background and felt a little lost after many years of dancing and performing in typical competitive dance studios. I was older, not of competing age and not pursuing dance professionally BUT I still loved to dance. I definitely fell into the right hands at Breakout. I'm more fit and stronger than I ever have been and I've gained life long friendships. The atmosphere is nothing but love and I couldn't ask for anything more!!”

- “I came in for a freshwater pump replacement. They not only fixed that but they found other problems and fixed them too. They always explained extensively and asked beforehand. They were extremely helpful, and they knew my Roadtrek inside out! These people are great. And considering inventory limitations because of shipping these days, they still have many parts on hand. I recommend them highly.”
- “Our experience with the Sandy's RV West staff was excellent in every way. This is an incredible business that gave us integrity and excellence in all areas of buying and selling selling our Class B RV.”
- “If you have a Class B Motorhome and are having problems in the Tucson area, Sandy's is the place to take it.  I've been dealing with a leak in my Roadtrek for a couple of years.  Since I live in CA, the leak would come and go depending on the amount of rainfall (none most years) we had.  I decided to have 'fresh eyes' look at the problem, and fortunately Sean had some time and did that for me.  He found the potential leak and was able to seal it for me; still haven't had enough rain to test it, but I'm pretty sure he found it.  And if you're lucky enough to be there when 'Sandy' is there, the old gentleman has some amazing stories to tell!”

- “Took our Four Winds RV in because the water heater would not work on electrical power.  Sean said our power management box was not functioning and needed to be replaced.  After some research, he told us that the box wasn't available for a month and we could either wait or have him install a switch that would allow either the water heater or the microwave to work.  Nothing about having the other electrical outlets being non-functional on shore power.  Off we went on our two week vacation only to discover that the only way we could get ONE of the outlets to work was to use the chassis power via inverter.  No shore power in outlets but microwave and frig would work.  Ended up trying to use the TV only to have it blow out from apparently the incorrect voltage.  Also discovered the day of departure that the power management box was available overnight on Amazon.  Can't way I'm impressed with the workmanship of this shop.  If I can get them to fix the mess they created, I certainly won't be returning for future work.”

Road trips in an RV are so much fun. They carry all the RV parts you will need!

- “The best service at reasonable prices, Bill VerSchave not only came to repair our washer, but took care of the problem with our refrigerator, that another company said couldn't be fixed, that's service.  Now the other company, I'm not naming, took care of our refrigerator a couple times, the ice maker, and other issues.  We called them to fix our water dispenser, and told us that due to the fact that the hoses were behind the refrigerator door, sealed, they couldn't fix it.  Well Bill repaired the leak in the back, and when it still wouldn't work, he used a makeshift bottle, put hot water in it, squeezed it up the water spout, and like magic, it worked.  The water in that hose freezes occasionally, but now we know how to fix it, thanks to Bill.  The other company apparently are not that smart.  Bill also worked for Sears and Kristy's appliances, great guy too.  If you have any appliance issues, give him a call, you will thank me.  BTW, he fixed our washer, took the motor home, fixed the belt and belt pulley brought it back and fixed.”
- “Bill is professional, honest, and shows up within the promised time frame.  I called regarding my dryer that was not drying well. He determined the vent to the roof needs cleaning - beyond the scope of what he does. Good news though: the dryer is fine. He explained the issue with the vent and gave me some recommendations for companies to clean the vent and solutions to prevent future problems.   I'll definitely use BVS again for my appliance service needs.”
- “I have had Bill come out twice, once for my freezer and once for my washing machine. Beyond being professional and efficient, he is honest. If you are need an appliance fixed, I wouldn't hesitate to call him over any other person or company.”

- “The stated process, per 2-10's website, is the repairman diagnoses the problem proposes a fix and gets approval from 2-10 to proceed. That did not happen. The repairman? Decided on his own 2-10 would not pay for the fix, took his fee and left. No receipt, no invoice. That is not professional.”
- “BVS was dispatched by the warranty company to fix a defective microwave display. To me it is unreadable. But the serviceman refused to touch the oven because if you get right on top of it you can read the letters and numbers. Some of which had unreadable segments even from close range. Sites on the web say this is a known problem with GE microwaves and is corrected by replacing three capacitors on the display board. Not a big job if you have the tools and parts. My bad, I thought appliance repair guys repaired appliances. Out $60 because BVS didn't call to get details of the problem.”

- “Just moved to Tucson from Florida and registered my car today.  Realized  at 8 pm that I didn't have the correct tool to remove the FL plate and put the AZ plate on.  I Googled auto parts stores near me and called the closest one which was O'Riley's on Tanque Verde.  Matt answered and assured me if I went there they'd have a tool and he'd help me.  True to his word Matt was eager to assist, using tools from a tool box on their counter and didn't even charge me.  He could not have been nicer or more helpful and words cannot express my gratitude.  It was THE bright spot in my week.  You rock Matt, thank you very much!!  .   Thanks to Matt, O'Rileys has won my business for any automotive needs I have going forward.”
- “Who knew removing a dead battery from the car could become a nightmare?!  I tried to start the car yesterday afternoon, and it would not start.  We were going to remove the battery, take it to get it checked to see if it could  hold a charge and just needed jumping, or if it needed to be replaced.  After 20 minutes of fighting with it, the terminal was so corroded, it would not loosen and we were afraid it would break off.  We found jumper cables, got it started and drove to this O'Reilly location.  Brad asked what we needed and I explained.  He brought out the tester, determined that it had a charge, but that a cell was bad and the battery needed replacing.  He spent the better part of the next hour using various tools and WD 40 to finally get the terminal loosened.  The hold down was in the same condition, but he continued quietly working, all the while explaining what he was trying to do and patiently working at it.  He had to move some other parts to get the battery out of the engine compartment.  He installed the new battery, replacing the corroded terminal and hold down with new parts.  He had me start the car to be sure it worked.  He then checked to be sure everything was cleaned up, tools removed and, once again, checked all the connections to the battery.  I wish I could get such excellent service at an auto dealership!!  He did such a wonderful job, I couldn't feel bad about spending time in a parking lot watching someone work.  I really do believe O'Reilly goes to great length to hire knowledgeable, helpful and patient people to represent their brand and Brad went well beyond any expectations I had.  Bravo!”
- “Can not say enough good things about the employee Sandy. Everyone at this location is so kind, hands on and quick. My favorite Oreilly in Tucson!”

- “Great price, prompt installation, quality work. Will return there for any more of my auto glass needs.”
- “We had went to 6 other places including Chapman where my daughter got her car and we were told sorry we cant help. My daughters window fell out but did not break. No one would tell us how to fix it or why it fell out. My daughter saw the yellow sign and we went to check it out. The worst they could tell us was no again. We met Jeff. He not only told us that he could help but it would not cost her a fortune to fix. Jeff went about fixing it and he helped her get the goop off the seats. Jeff saves the day. He was professional,  kind, and helpful. I will recommend this place to anyone who needs a windshield or window repair. Thank you so much Jeff. You are an angel.”

- “This company really does not have it together at all when it comes to customer service!! They advertise that they will deal with insurance so you don't have to buy then show up and ask you to call insurance yourself!! They advertise that they will give you cash for using them but then they forget to bring the gift cards!!! They say that they will be there between 9 and 10 and when you call at 10:30 to ask where they are, they apologize and say sorry, someone called out, your new window is later in the day!?!?  The technician was the only good thing about this company. He was nice and polite and did a good job.”
- “I just received a phone call from this auto glass place called Auto Glass Now on Speedway and supposedly I had an appointment with them. I had NEVER even heard of this place until I received that phone call from them!! Apparently, they had me scheduled for some kind of windshield appointment that I never made in the first place. So, needless to say, I freaked out because somebody obviously is giving out my info. Anyhow, this first guy that called was named Kevin,I let him know I didn't make any appointments with them and he just said okay and we hung up. That's fine but then some asshole named Geoff called me from that same auto glass place and tries telling me I talked to him and made the appointment. Guess what?? I didn't talk to him either because again, as I mentioned before, I HAD NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THIS PLACE UNTIL THEY CALLED ME TODAY!! That guy Geoff starts raising his voice to me arguing with me insisting that I talked to him when I know I didn't!! This guy Geoff has the nerve to hang up on me  while I was talking so I called back, Geoff answered and I started telling him not to be calling my phone and getting stupid with me. Guess what he did when I was starting to tell him all of this?? Geoff proceeded to call me a crazy bitch. Yes, he did which is why I'm leaving this review and after that treatment all the more so I'll never give this place any business!! Geoff, if you're reading this-GOOD!! I hope you do!! So, these are the kind of people who run this shop. By the way, Geoff...you want to know something?? About you calling me a crazy bitch. You haven't seen crazy!!”
- “Even tho they say they care about customer relations they won't reimburse me for damage done to my Dodge truck and covered it up so I didn't know of the problem until I was 1000 miles away. On top of that when I brought the truck to an  Auto Glass Now dealer in Mo. they had to replace the entire window because it leaked badly. Still refusing to pay my repair bill of $250.00. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE. Only have your work done there if it is the last place on Earth.  Tad M Bero  Work was done at Auto Glass Now in Tucson”

- “Don't let the outside fool you--the inside is totally remodeled and looks and feels great.   Our king room with walk-in shower was spotless clean and came with all the usual amenities (shampoo, conditioner, coffee, etc.). Room was very spacious. Noise insulation was good.   It was lovely to have a balcony with mountain views, although sadly much too cold to sit outside.   Parking was a breeze.   Susannah and the rest of the staff were super nice and accommodating.   They had complimentary happy hour 5-6:30pm, although we weren't able to attend.  Regarding covid procedures, the staff was following the rules, everything felt clean, and there were reminder distancing signs posted, although some of the guests didn't seem to have gotten the memo (totally not the hotel's fault, obviously).   Breakfast was grab and go style with a lovely lady serving behind the counter. One could either sit inside/outside, but they give you a carton tray to take your items with you, too. Items included: yogurt, 3 types of fresh muffins (individually wrapped), fruit, hot and cold cereal, fruit bars, chocolate and regular milk, coffee and juices served by the lady, teas, and two hot options of either a cheese, ham and egg breakfast burrito or cheese and egg bagel. I was pretty impressed with the options, considering other places I've stayed at during covid either had given up on breakfast all together, or just did yogurt, granola and muffins to go. Only wish breakfast went a little later (ends at 9am on weekdays), but then again I was on vacation and am not a morning person ;)  Would definitely stay here again!”
- “Misty went above and beyond with our drinks. We had a  bigger party and her service was excellent. Super fast and her knowledge was spot on.  I'll be staying here every time I'm in Tucson. Cheers!”
- “I had the most amazing time last weekend at the 4 Element Bar and restaurant inside the Embassy Suits on Speedway in Tucson, AZ. Leave it to Chef Knott, Misty, Jill, and the rest of the team for making our weekend the best! I'm sure we've tried almost everything on the menu and there's nothing to disappoint. My pictures look good but make sure to check out and follow the chefs Instagram @ chefrichardknott and be prepared to drool! We had some bbq and honey siracha wings, fish and short rib tacos, planko crusted chicken, the buttered steak with asparagus and of course our absolute favorite the fried cheesecake! I truly can't say enough about the food something only to experience for yourself and that's not where it stops, the service you get is truly fabulous as well. Misty is amazing, warm and welcoming and make you feel right at home, I tend to give people a hard time and she knew how to kick it right back at us, Jill always make sure we are taken care of and we truly love the attention. It really is such a good vibe and we can't wait to be back in November for our birthdays! Thanks guys so much we love you all!!!   I tried to label the pics to the best of my memory but the menu has all the details and what's included!  Check out the chef Instagram @ chefrichardknott”

- “I use Yelp all the time, but rarely write reviews.  But after visiting Wild Orchids Salon, I felt the salon really deserved it.  I am not from around this area and needed to find a salon that used the same products as back home.  When I called the salon, the receptionist was very nice and informative.  She referred me to Allie.  I felt very comfortable with Allie and loved the work she did on my hair.  Knowing I was only in the area temporarily, she easily could have done less than average work.  But this wasn't the case at all!  She went above and beyond what I had expected.  For that I was very grateful.  I was able to see her one last time before I left Tucson.  So happy I was able to leave with a positive hair experience!”
- “A wonderful salon!  I am so happy with the skills of my stylist, and the service is really nice!! Everyone greets you and offer coffee or something to drink. My stylist is such a wonderful person and her knowledge exceeds her years. Recommend this salon without a doubt.”
- “Yahaira Larson is a miracle worker! This review is overdue by a few weeks, but I felt compelled to get this out there so people would know about the amazing job she did on my locks! I had about 4+ inches of gray hair growth on dark reddish/brown hair and I'm not talking about those beautiful silver strands you see on some lucky gals...just unruly white...but Yahaira made my hair look like a million bucks when she was done! I'm on the road a lot for work and personal (#rvliving LOL) so it's hard to know where I'll be or where I'm going. That uncertainty is what had been delaying me on getting my hair did. I found myself in Tucson, Arizon in December for a few days and Michelle at Wild Orchids Salon was kind enough to invite me to the salon last minute to do a patch test since I have sensitive skin. After confirming the Goldwell Nectaya would work on my skin, Yahaira squeezed me in just a few days later since we were hitting the road again. Thanks so much Yahaira & Michelle! You guys saved the day and me and my hair thank you for it!”

- “This is a friendly neighborhood salon but beware.   The stylists love to talk but they do not listen.  I asked to have my hair highlighted and instead she colors my entire head of hair.  Now I have dark, ugly roots growing in every month and have to have them colored or else go through an expensive time consuming process of having my hair weaved every month for a year. I called Wild Orchid Salon about this error and they were very nasty and  defensive and have a very poor public relations policy.  These people love to talk but do not listen.”
- “BUYER BEWARE:  About 3 months ago I experienced the wrath of an angry stylist at this salon, who had an argument with the person before me and viciously took it out on my hair. It traumatized me to the point that it has taken me this long to post a review. I didn't take a photo of the assault because I was so freaked out at what he did. But as a client who's had to live with hair butchery that forced me to go 'Sinead O'Connor' in order to correct the 'cut', I now want to warn others about Christopher. I have never in my life experienced such vicious incompetence in a haircut. In some parts of the 'cut' he almost went into the scalp (behind the ears) and even started cutting AT THE ROOT of the hair shaft ON TOP OF MY HEAD the whole time repeating-over and over "Dont be scared" as he thinned out my hair at the root. I had 3 previous cuts with this person and they were not butchery. But on this ocasión I was assaulted by a moody unprofessional who returned my money (he knows what he did) but not the stress and embarrassment of cutting my hair so short and so badly it made me look like a cancer patient. Now I worry that he has my credit card info but if he does anything shady, he'll be sorry he ever tried. Wild Orchid is responsible for their employees. So backatcha buddy.”
- “Beware of this salon-I asked the stylist for highlights and she colored my entire head of hair so now I have to have my roots colored every 4-6 weeks or go through an expensive time consuming process called weaving.  My hair is very thick so this process will take probably one year and with a cost of over $1200. I called the  salon about this but they were very nasty and defensive about the entire situation.  They definitely have a very poor public relations policy.”

- “This is one of the better parks to visit in Marana and it has a wide variety of activities and walking paths available. It is located on Cortaro between Silverbell and I-10, so it is also close to a lot of restaurants, wo you could even pack up a lunch and bring a picnic to enjoy. The town of Marana also hosts their annual 4th 9f July event here each year with a fireworks display. Additionally, the park offers free wifi services and there is a local library on the premises. Overall, this is one of the nicest spots to come and enjoy family activities in Marana, so make sure to check it out!”
- “We came to the Marana Fireworks Show!!  We loved everything about it... except maybe the ants (careful, there is rather a lot) 0.0  HUGE open spaces. Stadium lights kept everything safe and a lack of drunken idiots.  Nice people (including the #police), didn't rain -- so many CUTE kids!  Decent selection of food trucks, but wouldn't mind more legit BBQ.”

- “Smile Tucson is about as good as going to the Dentist gets. It's clean, tastefully decorated, and with a friendly and professional staff. The Dental assistants and Dentists are top notch and know what they are doing, providing an efficient painless experience. I would also recommend for kids as they have a great selection of movies to keep them engaged.  Check out Smile Tucson for your next checkup!”
- “I had a great experience with Dr. Garcia!  Last week, I was visiting family in the Tucson area.  I was eating lunch and suddenly, one of my fillings fell out!  My tooth was so sensitive!  My family recommended Dr. Garcia, since they go and see her as well.  They were able to fit me in right away.  Dr. Garcia had such amazing chairside manner.  She was very thorough with her explanation and treatment recommendation.  Turns out it wasn't just a filling that fell out, my tooth was cracked and I needed a crown!  Luckily, she was able to make the crown and place it the same day!  When my numbness wore off, things went back to normal.  I felt no pain or sensitivity afterwards.  Aside from Dr. Garcia being awesome, the staff was also very professional.  If I ever move to Arizona, I will definitely be visiting this office for my dental work.  Thank you guys!”
- “Wow, I just love Smile Tucson Family Dentistry. Dr. Garcia and Dr. Cross are honest,caring and are top notch when it comes to your dental needs.  Their entire staff does a great job making you feel comfortable and at home. We've had the pleasure of working with both hygienist. Lets me just say Chrissie and April are gentle and thorough.

- “This was THE worst experience, ever!  Dr Tim Cross was the most unprofessional, inhumane and unfeeling individual I had ever had the displeasure to deal with.  My daughter suffers from severe anxiety and especially fromt the dentist.  Upon her initial visit it was found that she had a filling to be done and two teeth to be pulled out.  For two weeks she would go to bed crying and thinking she will have to go through these procedures.  Finally the day of she was very nervous but she was willing to let them do what they would do.  Dr Cross was adamant that I must not touch my daughter at any time because that would make her more nervous and cause her to move.  He did the filling and then asked her if she wanted to pull her teeth out, obviously she said no.  He never checked with me to see what could work best for her.  She again had two more weeks of severe anxiety and anguish to wait to her teeth pulled.  We get to the office and the assistant requested that I stay in the lobby.  I said no, I will be going in with her, especially because she expressed how she feels better when I am there.  Dr Cross proceeded to numb the area and then wait to go in and pull the teeth.  During the wait I touched her leg to let her know I was there and to remain calm.  When Dr Cross came back he said I should take my hand off of her.  I said no I will not.  He called me over to the side and told me he knew what was best for my daughter, he did not ask me about her anxiety or question what could possibly work best.  I expressed how I thought it was wrong from the beginning to give her the choice of having her teeth pulled out and how that made it worst.  That is when he said that because I did not trust his judgement he will not be pulling her teeth out and he was basically kicking us out.  He took me to his office and I proceeded to beg him to proceed with the procedure for the benefit of my daughter.  He proceeded to call another dentist so we can go elsewhere.  I was in literal tears beggin him to please not do this to her.  He sat and stared me down for about 5 minutes.  Finally  I told him he was right about everything because I felt  that is the only way he was willing to proceed.  The discussion took about half hour.  I said I would not touch her and then without a word he walked out, pulled her teeth out and it took about 5 minutes.  Dr Tim Cross has absolutely no bed-side manner, he is arrogant, uncaring to the condition of his patient, he was willing to kick us out just because I was not willing to do exactly what he wished.  I felt abused but more than anything my daughter was NOT given the care she deserved.  I do not recommend this dentist to anyone, especially anyone with children.  He needs to go back to school and learn how to handle people in a kind and compassionate way.”

- “I woud have to say the guy at the door is strikingly handsome. Very friendly. I notice the ring on the finger. Must be a lucky lady in his life.  The service is always exceptional. The entire staff is always so nice. Looking, buying, dreaming...doesnt matter. Great times!!”
- “I think it goes without saying that Tiffany & Co is EXPENSIVE!!! But, But, they have exceptional customer service. Weather you are in there to purchase something or just to take a peak at what will be on your wish list you are always made to feel welcome.  I went in just to try on a bracelet and then be on my way. I 2 gentleman and 2 ladies greet me and ask if they could assist me with anything. I was just admiring all the shiny accessories and felt as if I was being treated as someone who was going to buy something. This store is so friendly, it's worth just taking a look around.”
- “I've been to this store almost 10 years ago with my BFFs. We got identical venetian link bracelets w our initial charms. As I could remember, it was a pleasant experience. Last Christmas, my boyfriend got me a pair of heart-shaped "Return to Tiffanys" logo earrings, which I loved! I asked how was the buying experience he had. He laughed & said that it's those kind of store where it would be a bit awkward to just get in there browsing aimlessly. But he said the staff was very polite. We come in to the store today to get buy a bottle of perfume & a bracelet to give as a gift & a very helpful SA, Carmen, made my daughter to look forward getting something nice for herself in the near future. Thank you for the excellent service, Tiffanys staff!”

- “I am a regular customer at Tiffany & Co and after my recent experience after my purchase of diamond earrings I will NEVER return to this location. I bought a pair of diamond earrings and was pressured to wear the earrings out. The manager at the time handed me the earrings one at a time to put on without a mirror at the register. I wore them home and didn't take them off for a few weeks and went to clean them because I had irritation behind one of my ear lobes. When I took off my earrings I realized the manager gave me 2 different backs. One was silver and the other was white gold. (See Pictures) I called the store right away and spoke to Linda about the situation. She asked me to send her pictures via email and come into the store so she can see the earrings for herself. I told her I am 45 minutes away from the store and will have to come in on a Saturday. She noted to ask for the manager Rob if I end up coming in on Saturday. I came into the store and asked for Rob and explained to him the situation. Rob had the same demeanor as Linda and said this is, " highly unlikely to happen". I was beside myself as if he was calling me a liar. My mom was by my side and she said she didn't like the way he handled the situation. He went back to clean my earrings and get the correct back to my diamond earrings to "make it right".   I walked out of Tiffany & Co feeling belittled as if I had done something wrong remembering Rob's response " the is highly unlikely to happen" to me when I showed him the earrings. My advice to anyone that makes a purchase from Tiffany & Co to check their merchandise before taking it home. Make sure the backs to earrings go with the set purchased and they match.”
- “I am visiting town and got some lotion in my ring and needed it cleaned. I stopped in to see if they could clean it for me and they responded "is it from tiffanys?" When I replying no they told me they couldn't help me. I was the only person in the store so it wasn't like they were busy helping others. From a customer service perspective it was pretty rude. Who knows, maybe I would have shopped around a bit while I waited to have it cleaned.”

Love this place!!! Always friendly service Get a charm soldered on, cleaning is included. Nice !!!!

- “Wonderful experience! Very thorough and wanted to make sure she had a vision of what I wanted for my hair. Relaxing atmosphere. Love my hair! Found my new salon!”
- “I've never professionally waxed the unibrow or rocked fake nails (other than those old Lee Press-Ons when I was twelve, of course). It normally takes me twenty minutes to get ready each morning, tops.   But lately I haven't been satisfied with the worn-down countenance that glowers back at me in the mirror. After Internetting furiously, I chose the nearest full-service hair salon for eye lash extensions, which out here in Vail is About Me.  My stomach was clenched in knots as I shuffled ambivalently toward the reception area, but a smiling employee immediately picked up on my deer-in-headlights stare and gently welcomed me. The walls serenely reassured me that "it's a good day to have a good day" and reminded me to "live every day with intention."   Once situated, I idly mentioned to my stylist, Arely, that I was terrified of going from lachrymose rabbit eyes to having arachnoid protrusions bulging from my eye sockets. After a brief discussion, we agreed on the "classic look," which means attaching one synthetic extension to each of my already existing eye lashes. She said I'd just look like I was wearing mascara, tooootally normal.  Keep in mind that I was visually impaired throughout the whole process, but I'm told it goes something like this:  You lie corpselike on a recliner facing into the sun with your eyes scrunched shut. Each prosthetic lash is individually dipped in glue and bonded to your natural eyelash, which takes around ten seconds to dry apiece.   I was REALLY glad that I'd opted to remove my hard contact lenses prior to getting started. Even so, at some point, my eyes began to well up and spring a leak. Thanks to the knowledge droppers at Dr. Google, I was expecting anaphylaxis, scarring and blindness to ensue. Happy day, though...I'm just photosensitive. Eye hair dryers are actually a thing, believe it or not!  According to Internet Experts, getting a full set of lashes installed should take up to two hours, but my glabrous lids only took around an hour. For that reason, I was only charged $120 (plus tip) instead of the advertised price of $150.  ***  "Hmm...those would be great for date night, but don't you think they're too much for every day?" my husband asked tentatively.  After curiously evaluating my reflection for the last 20 minutes, I'd been wondering the same thing but would have preferred that he shut the hell up. They didn't look outlandish; just more glamorous than I look, well, ever.  *** Arely had sent me home with some instructions, which I've followed with limited success. "Sleep on your back like a mummy" ain't gonna happen. I've continued to sleep in the fetal position - as God intended - without waking up to a pillow full of effluvium. I do wash my eyelids gently with some Johnson's Head-to-Toe Baby Wash first thing in the morning and brush my lashes with a plastic disposable mascara wand. Speaking of mascara, that's verboten. Other than that, it's not a huge change to my bare-bones morning routine.  *** A few days later, and I've  never received so many compliments from both friends and strangers after a run-in with a beautician. I'm not talking about from just the Karens and Susans in my age group, but the Taylors and Madisons as well. As it turns out, almost all of the mom friends sport these appendages and I'd never even noticed.  So, it looks like I will be planting my decrepit ass back in that chair for an hour once every three weeks to get refurbished.”
- “I recently moved to the area and was nervous about finding a good hair stylist who is up to date on current trends etc.  Happily, Ellie had an appointment available. This talented girl knows her stuff.  She applied my hair color with accuracy and she has the sweetest personality ever. My hair color came out PERFECT! And, she nailed the style that I wanted. I felt so pretty walking out of the salon. I recommend Ellie 100 percent!!!”

- “I took my son here for the first time and I also was scheduled for me his mother to get my hair done but after his hair I wouldn't ever come back. I waited for somebody to Come to the front desk then where all in the back talking and laughing slowly walks out I had a apt which they didn't get to us for another 15 minutes then sat down get simple haircut for 12 year old boy and the haircut she took over a hour to cut his hair and kept stopping and looked like she didn't know how to cut it. Then hour and half I walk up to them and say almost done what's going on she said ya just finishing up I had to tell her the hair was chopped the pieces where different lengths and it was so bad I paid 40 bucks for a kids haircut at that and then I complained she said she can re do it another weekend I said why would I want to come get it more chopped up a lot of pieces where shorter then others I am not exaggerating it was worse haircut he has had great clips has done better for 20 bucks . Then the lazy desk goes back comes back in 10 more min and says we'll that's all I can do I never went back but some compensation would have been nice 40 bucks for kids haircut and bad one ridiculous”

- “I lived in Tucson fr over 33 years, and this was the second time I had been to this Museum!   The first time was WAY before social media had been invented.   I bought a two day pass (it is actually 11 dollars a day for that) , and broke up exploring the MASSIVE museum.    There is so much rich aviation history here, words just are not enough.... All branches of the military are covered here, and if you are a history buff.....you will be in heaven!   Fighter jets, HUGE transport planes, the role of females in aviation....even former White House transport planes.     Some are in hangers, some are outside but either way there are volunteers who know A LOT about these planes, and the history of them.    I left the space center and the fighter wing memorial for the second day...and that was perfect.    This hidden gem in Tucson is worth every single penny.   The gift ship has a nice selection , and they even have REAL airplane parts for sale!!”
- “My wife and I were on vacation in Tucson and I have seen this place from the movie Can't buy me Love, which I saw about ten times in 1987 when I was 13 and we all needed an air-conditioned spot in Tempe, AZ when it was 100 degrees outside and it was at the dollar theatre.  My father-in-law knows a dude that works there, so we got a special behind the scenes tour. It reminded me of the Midway aircraft carrier in San Diego with all the cool aircraft from the military on display. They had one of only 4 B-36 bobmers left in the field. The plane is HUGE!  It is only about a 10 minute drive out of main Tucson, I would highly recommend it. Just walking around is worth the admission, plus they have a ton of bombers in the 4 or 5 hangers on the premesis. Check it out.”
- “The biggest air museum I have ever been to. Lots of aircraft from old to newer and all different kind of aircraft.”

- “There are a lot of old planes here so if you're really into that, go for it. but I won't be going back. I took a Dutch friend here and we were walking through a room dedicated to WWII memorabilia. The guy behind the desk, and elderly gent, for know apparent reason remarked to us that YOU KNOW HITLER HAD SOME GREAT IDEAS, HE JUST WENT A LITTLE TOO FAR.  It was so bizarre, i had to process it a bit. Then i circled back to him, and tried to reason with him by calmly expressing my view of his remarks as a Jew whose father fought in WWII and whose mother escaped the Nazis as they took over Austria, and who had brought a friend from one of the many countries HITLER THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT IDEA TO INVADE. This "museum" which undoubtedly "educates" children who visit should do a much better job educating and vetting its staff.”
- “I'm here to review Jonathan B's review from 1/07/2016, where he said, "I am not a fan of war history museums that do not show clear reasons why these machines were built and what may have been the consequences.  It does not teach the consequences of wars, which I think many museums in the United States need to do."  This young man is clearly a product of our public school system. His ignorance of history and American civics is beyond belief. Yes, wars are horrible. But as long as despots exist, wars will exist. And the country or countries being attacked have every right to defend themselves.  Tens of millions of American men & women have defended our nation, wearing a Navy, Marine Corps, Army, Air Force or Coast Guard uniform. Millions have died or been wounded while wearing that uniform. Their sacrifices provide the liberty for Precious Snowflakes like Jonathan B to make idiotic statements like the one above.  As for myself, I am looking forward to my visit to this museum and I will be truly thankful for the opportunity to see the results of American ingenuity and bravery.”
- “This one star is strictly based on their misinformation on their website.  We traveled out of our way on a cross-country trip to stop there to let the kids get out and stretch their legs. We arrived at 1:45.  It said they close at 3:00.  We were told we could not go in b/c they stop allowing people in at 1:00.  Why would you advertise 3:00 as your close if you close at 1:00?????  She told us, We start corralling people at about 2:15 and start making them head toward the gift shop to leave so they can all be out by 3:00.  THAT IS THE STUPIDEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD.  And there were at least a dozen people who showed up right around the same time that were also really unhappy.  So we drove 30 minutes out of our way for nothing.  Needless to say, we won't bother if we're ever close enough again.”

## Tips from customers
Remember our veterans and all the efforts of the military and the space programs as it relates to all things aerial. This place is awesome! Sunglasses are a must!! This place is da' Bomb! Great museum with a lot of cool airplanes, helicopters, etc. Night Wings is pretty cool! Dinner at the Flight Grill was yummy. Kids are having a great time. 3rd largest air museum in US. And it is overwhelmingly huge. An absolute must see. You actually can touch most of the aircraft!!! VIP Reception for NASA's Multi-purpose Crew Module Flight Test Vehicle.....phew, a mouthful! Excited for the Boneyard bus tour! Last admissions are at 3pm, for it takes longer than 2 hours to enjoy even a majority of the museum. Take the tram tour. A ton of information. Entrance stops at 3pm even though they close at 5pm Dog friendly! Leashed dogs welcomed in the museum. Arizona is building the MPCV--America's next human exploration spacecraft--on display here thru 8pm--COME ON OUT!!! Long line and it just opened! The tour guides are very informative. Leashed dogs welcome! I just posted a review on Pima Air & Space Museum that's not showing up on my timeline. I'm not sure why. Apparently YELP doesn't think my Pima Air Museum Check-In deserves to be on my page :( GEEZZZZZ THANKS YELP See Air Force 1 if you can and say hi to my Gramps who's a volunteer in the Liberator exhibit! Also the flight simulator is gone. Free fast wifi. Only at Main Hangar.
No sign said they have wifi but you try you will find it. No password require Spend the six bucks for the tram tour - it will give your feet a break, and you will definitely learn a lot from the knowledgeable tour guide! Admission $15.5, tram tour $6 is a guided tour that take you through 300 planes. I doubt I can walk all over 80 acres.The tour is one hour in duration. Every 2 hrs. 

Expect to spend at least 3 hours in this museum. 

I want to do the AMARG tour $7 M-F only it takes you to the AFB boneyard nearby mainly for military aircraft but I don't have enough time.

Tour filled up fast, on Monday the 11:30am team tour was full. I came here early if you plan come late buy tix online prior to arrive Bottled water and sunscreen are a MUST if you visit.  It doesn't matter if it's fall or winter - you will be thirsty, and you will burn!  Bring a backpack, and be prepared! Absolutely the best display of aircraft I have personally ever seen.  If you're undecided about going, just do it - you won't be disappointed! Tram tour $6, left or right seat doesn't matter Bec docents introduced both left and right sides aircrafts during the tour. Just get to the waiting area early to get a window seat (4 people seat in one row). It's 70 degree day but still wind kind chill (they call it air condition) and the sun was kind bright. Don't do the tram tour. It's not worth it. It's slow and long and the guide is boring. Everything else is awesome. Bring water, wear comfortable shoes and note that the museum, tram tour and graveyard bus each incurr a different cost. Bring plenty of water, Sunglasses, Hat and camera  its awesome They have sunscreen free in bathrooms! Use it before wandering outside in this huge museum. Super, super, super.
The tour was wo Dog friendly. Very nice and knowledgeable staff willing to answer your questions. Restroom available everywhere. Make sure to visit the 390th Memorial Museum on site. It's incredible. Listen to the actual airmen tell their stories on the interactive display. Awesome family place, tour guides are super fun and informative. TIP: It takes two days to really enjoy and see all the Pima Air & Space Museum displays. Bring bottled water. Incredible number of planes! This is an amazing museum.  Ultra friendly staff.  Love the outdoor collection and make sure you do the boneyard tour as well. my son loved it Wow just cool! Amazing place to visit!

Everyone is very knowledgable and extremely helpful, everything from helping me pick out products to loading my car up.. I've never been disappointed with their excellent customer service. All their bird feed is made in house.. if you are ever in the area come in and check it out.. you might just end up walking out with something special”
- “I love this store and highly recommend coming here for all your bird needs!! The Couple that own the store are very personable and extremely knowledgeable about birds, food and great about giving you tips for your whatever bird habitat you want to create. They make their own food blends that are top quality and the Hummingbird mix is the best around! They also have beautiful hand crafted bird houses and unique habitats made by local artists. I love that it is a family business and I feel they truly appreciate the patronage. You will spend a bit more here but the quality and supporting a local, family owned business is worth it! Make it a stop even to just look or have bird questions, you will not be disappointed!”
- “I'm impressed with their quality and selection of food and feeders. Owner was very helpful, and I can tell he has high standards for what he sells. I've shopped there only once and look forward to getting some more seed. Thank you for being a wonderful business -- the birds are definitely coming to my yard!”

- “I drove from San Diego to Tucson to buy bird blocks to feed the quail in my backyard. I ordered 10 of the 25 lb blocks and was told I would get a 10% discount for that quantity. When I got home and opened the first box it was full of little bugs. So were several others. I also noticed my AmEx bill did not reflect the promised discount but was so discussed with the whole event decided "move on" so as to not be more stressed by these people. josh is the guy I talked to when I first called. BE CAREFUL DEALING WITH THIS STORE.”

- “I pretty much go to O'Reillys for everything. I used to go to Checker but they don't seem to have one here in Tucson. This location rocks. They beat out the AutoZone right across the street every time. I was at the AutoZone this morning because I'm doing a tuneup on my car and the guy was pushy and had zero customer service. So we went to O'Reillys and we got a really good deal on sparkplugs/wires, an oil change kit, fuel injector cleaner, and an air filter. Came out just over 100$, at AutoZone it was like 130$. We got a good deal and the man that helped us walked right up to us and, even though he didn't seem to be in the best mood, he did his job and the effort was put in to make sure we got what we needed. I apologize, O'Reilly's, I'll never go to AutoZone again! Lol.”

- “This is hands-down the BEST sandwich shop in Tucson.  A true local spot.  I love the PBR Sammy, but you can't really go wrong with anything.  This place should be on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  Don't miss the beef sticks and the homemade horseradish pickles.  A Tucson gem, locally owned and operated, so support the hell outta them!”
- “Ordered the "Richard"...perhaps the best Reuben I have ever had.  My only issue is with the bread...not robust enough to handle the sandwich.”
- “Have always loved the Suzie Sorority sandwich!  Never have had a bad lunch at Sausage Deli.”

- “Do you not eat here the clerk came in from eating and smoking a cigarette and went right to the counter and did not put on gloves and started making sandwiches and handling the meat with her bare hands. The fire department was even there at the time and I guess they didn't notice that the people making their sandwiches were not wearing gloves. Eat here at your own risk it is not the customers job to ask the person making their sandwich to put on a damn glove.”
- “Their hours are posted on their door as being from 9am to 4pm on Saturdays, yet I was there this morning at 9am and their doors were shut. No sign communicating whatsoever to their customers they would be closed today.”

- “I m back for cleaning and xrays. First time with dental coverage so we ll see how the bill goes. Thank you Mary for helping me stay healthy.  Condition reviewed by dr Allen and have me his stamp of approval.   Update June 2020 Back tomorrow for my cleaning by Mary.   She is so gentle. No suffering on my part.”
- “Dr. Allen at the Pantano office is the most amazing dentist I have ever visited. My children have both had bad experiences in the past and I was hoping after hearing so much praise for Aeris Dental from Mother's at our school that this would be a good choice for us. Now my entire family and extended family go to Dr. Allen. We don't have dental insurance and we pay from our HSA for X-rays and treatment. The rates are extremely affordable and the work is top notch. In all the years we have been going to this dentist my children have only ever had cleanings and my younger son had a filling (which he came out smiling after and said that it was no problem!) ... their old dentist filled their teeth at every appointment which must have just been unnecessary work.  Having a dentist that you can trust, that doesn't charge you a fortune, where all of the staff are kind and amazing is priceless. Love love love this place.”
- “I had my first visit today. The staff greeted me as if I had been coming there for a long time. Comfortable setting and first-rate technology. Wonderful professional staff from hygienist Shawn and Dr Allen.”

- “Needed new hinges on a security door after they'd rusted solid/broken the welds. Fast response (within two days the repair was complete, and on a Saturday), did a great job, even painted it. Very very reasonable rates too. It was a simple enough job but done quickly, efficiently, and with skill.”
- “Phil's mobile welding is fantastic.  Here are four examples why:   1.  Expertise, called and sent pictures of the job to repair two connected driveway gates that would not close due to bent and corroded j-bolts and rigging.  Required welding new J-bolts and installing cane rods.  Perfect job, great welds and the 15 year old gate works perfectly.   2.  Reliable, despite a labor shortage, Phil was out on Friday, scoped the work procured the parts over the weekend, and executed the work first thing Monday morning.  Followed up on calls, was exactly on time - responsive to text messages, etc.  Read:  RELIABLE.   3.  Flexible, once on site, asked him to look at a separate gate and move the gravity lock, flip the gate to swing the other direction.  Phil happily squeezed the additional work in - again, great job. 4.  Honest, genuine and polite / professional!  Estimate exceeded final bill.  Phil worked the entire time, did not drag out the effort to meet the hourly estimate.  Walked back his estimate and charged me only for the hours on site - rolled parts into cost. In closing - highly recommend and will use again for mobile welding requirements.  Thank you Phil.”
- “Phil is super nice and he came all the way across town to my home to fix my mailbox after I got home from work! Small job most people would go to the corner to do- Blazing hot outside and he got here and got right to work! It was a bit more than just tacking the box back on- needed to use a piece of metal he had on hand to weld to the uprights so there was something sturdy to weld the baseplate to then drilled through that metal and screwed the baseplate to the metal he added! Now its ON THERE! And he has great prices!  **Highly recommend and will use again when needed**”

- “Contacted Phil, came out took a look at the gate. Told me he could do it this weekend and never came back or even bothered calling me. He told me he was the man for the job. Recently I followed to see what happen and he told me that he's to busy now.....So I will start looking for another Mobile Welder.”

- “I canceled my appointment because I received a booster from COVID a day before and didn't feel well at all the next day to go. I didn't know I will feel bad. They have my card saved in their system and,without telling me nothing, very happily charged me $75.00. That's make me think these people don't care about you at all just your money. So be careful.”
- “I felt mistreated by ZL MedAesthetics.  I have been a returning customer spending roughly $200 a month for over a year.  The spa had a returning customer 20% discount if you book at the end of your appointment which I appreciated and took advantage of.  On occasion I would need to reschedule these future appointments.  This was one of those time in which I had rescheduled.  Upon checkout I was surprised that they had removed my discount without informing me when I changed the appointment.  I asked the owner why I lost the discount and she responded "well they must have just been nice to you"  I asked for what their policy was, as I would be more careful with schedule conflicts if I had known and her response was that they didn't have a formal policy.  I appreciate that they offer a discount, but I would prefer that they had been clear with me on their true policies.  They had set an expectation for service in my mind and then broke that expectation, didn't show any remorse and left me with a "too bad for you" attitude.  Spas live and die by customer service.  I will go elsewhere where I feel valued as a customer for my frequent return visits.”

Best Hydrafacial ever!!! You won't find better service anywhere else. Laura and her team really are the best in the industry.

- “I've been using this location for all of my tire needs for the past 15 years.  I have NEVER been disappointed.  Today, they removed nails and repaired punctures on two tires. I had an appointment for 9:30, and I was on my way by 10:00-- no charge.  As has always been the case, I was greeted promptly and courteously.  All of their staff that I have ever encountered at this location exemplify professionalism, and customer focus.  I can't imagine using another source for my tire-related needs.”
- “Great service!  As a female I'm always weary of walking into a car store and being treated as though I don't know what I want or need. But I didn't feel that way here. They were quick, helpful, and friendly.  I felt like I got the best deal.  They fixed two leaking tires for free and I purchased two to replace the almost bald tires in the front.”
- “42 minutes and I was out. Had my check tire pressure light on after but drove around and it went away. I love my car and this is the only place in tucson that I'll let them touch my tires or car.”

- “Yesterday morning at 8am I made it to Discount Tire (Ina/Shannon) with a set of fairly new SUV tires, one of them leaking a bit of air. I was told that Discount Tire is repairing leaking tires for free, if they can be repaired. I was on my way to Phoenix and obviously late due to the air leak. It took them one hour to get to my car, which is ok, I didn't have an appointment. Soon after they started looking at my tire, they came back to me and told me that my tire had a bent nail in the tire that damaged the tire at two spots, therefore irreparable. Since replacing one tire is not save, they have quoted me $314 for replacing two tires. So I called Purcell, the place that sold me these tires. They asked me to come over to their shop, which is located on Oracle/Magee. Discount Tire told me that they have removed the nail, so the leak is now faster. I asked Discount Tire if they can put that same tire back on, which they did. I made it to Purcell, they took the tire down within 8 minutes, showed me the nail that was still in place, it caused only one hole, which they fixed for free within about 10 minutes. Shame on you, Discount Tire! You lied to me three times: 1. You said the nail was bent and made two holes. 2. You said the tire was irreparable. 3. You said you removed the nail. But you know what? I'm thankful to you that you did not remove the nail and that you did not puncture the tire with an additional hole. Thank you for that. But the big thank you and heartfelt hug goes to Purcell on Oracle/Magee: Fast and efficient and honest! I will tell all my friends about Purcell!”
- “Great store and service.  BUT DO NOT GET THEIR CREDIT CARD WITH SYNCHRONY BANK.  TERRIBLE BANK.  They don't apply the payments correctly for differed interest promotional purchases.   Thankfully I was able to pay mine in full after they didn't apply my payment correctly, and they tried to say it was late. I paid it 3 weeks prior to the due date.  I am never late on my payments and have exceptional credit. I waited an hour on the phone for a supervisor and was only able to talk to one via the chat on their website.  They have fixed it, (I hope)  but have already reported a late payment to the credit agencies.  Which they say they are repairing.  Could take 60 days.  NONE of my other credit cards have handled an account the way this bank has. My payments post fine. I will NEVER USE that card for my tire purchases again or recommend it to another consumer. BUYER BEWARE”
- “Brought my tire in to be fixed And they told me an hour and a 1/2. It was certificated. An hour and a 1/2 later they told me another hour and a 1/2. Finally at 4 hours my tire was done. The inside staff was short and cranky with me.  My father went there and had the same experience twice.  Neither one of us will ever go back to the store.”

## Tips from customers
Make an appointment, you get right in! Super friendly staff! Its refreshing to feel like they are not ripping me off Getting a flat fixed. Nice clean waiting area. About a 45 min wait. Quick easy and polite.  Ready to head out for my trip! nice, friendly and quick. Bought 4 new tires (great price) and out 15 minutes. Great customer service!

- “I'm giving 5 stars for the great customer service at OPV. All the staff have been really helpful and greet me when I come in and take the time to answer all of my questions. They even will offer you a coca-cola or water while you wait for your liquid to be made. I have been to a lot of other vapor stores in Tucson and none of them rival the quality of service here. There is a wide variety of flavors to choose from and sample. If you are new to vaping or an experienced vapor there is something here to make your experience better. If there was one thing I would recommend it would be to start selling brand name liquids in addition to the store flavors. Definitely the best shop in the area.”
- “My husband and I usually buy all our vape needs online but when his 2nd Cupti 2 broke at the same time as mine went missing we couldn't wait a week for new mods to come in the mail & we wanted to try something new because a coworker had a mod we really liked. We were looking for something with a lot of flavor. We decided to stop by OPV on payday because we remember when we had to resort to using an old vape but didn't have any coils for it they graciously gave us one for free that had been opened but not used. So on payday we returned. We were greeted by Mondo who knew from the pics of our coworkers mod exactly what we were looking for, he was actually vaping the model up from it himself. Mondo listened to our needs & situation and gave us a great deal on 2 Voopoo Drags with Valyrian coil kits. We always used Kangertech mods and were skeptical about changing brands but Mondo made us feel secure in the decision. Afterwards we did a tasting with him and got the deal of 3 15ml bottles for $22 and left very happy customers. This payday we returned for more juice & again was greeted by Mondo. He wanted to know how our new mods were working out & we let him know we were very pleased except my husbands did leak a little. Mondo immediately assessed his vape and offered to take apart and clean both of our vapes. The leaking, which started a week after we bought the vapes was simply because we vape at a little lower watt and my husband vapes a little more and his coil needed replacement. Considering it had been two weeks this made sense. So after cleaning our tanks and replacing our coils we did another tasting. As before Mondo was courteous and kind and professional and took good care of us and this time we left with 4 30ml bottles ea flavor as delicious as the next. Mondo was right about my husbands coil because it hasn't leaked since. So now every payday we vow to be there for coils and juice. I would recommend OPV to anyone, whether you think you know it all about vaping or just starting out. Everyone there is very kind and the atmosphere is beautiful and laid back. If ya vape and haven't been there yet go to OPV!!!”
- “I am so happy we went to this place.  You see my husband gets relief from cigs. Im opposed to smoking. HOWEVER, Keith (the owner) was at Shannon's slumber party, and handing out the information they have about E-CIGS.   We purchased for him a starter kit for 50.00 and two nicotine bottles (Mango Menthol and Dragonfruit) for the kit. We had a wonderful coupon of 20% off and left out of the deal paying only $53.00 for the whole thing.  NOW! in this starter kit for $50.00 you get two ECig bodies, two chargers and I believe at least 5 tanks.  The Ecig is easy to use, easy to fill and easy for my husband to operate.   Now - Keith and his staff are now family - my husband and the owner were reminiscing about Ohio and things and to see him enjoy a shopping experience is amazing. The business smells delicious - honestly and the lounge area is clean and the atmosphere is friends and family.  While we were there a regular came in, and i know this because they greeted them by name.  If you dont smoke - come and try.  If you do smoke - COME AND TRY!”

- “Extremely rude  Terrible customer service shop could use a broom I won't be stopping at the shop ever again”
- “DO NOT BUY MODS HERE. I bought an alien kit 4 months ago. At $112 and have bought an upgraded tank and all my liquids from them. (I knew I was spending more but didn't mind as I was keeping my money local). My mod went out on me and seemed like a simple swap. Smok website recommends that any warranty claims be dealt with through the retailer. My kit falls within the 6 month warranty. Well, the owner said he could do nothing as they will only take care of mods that fall under their own 1 month warranty. So know I have to hassle with phone calls, forms, and shipping my mod back.    For a brick and mortar company that sells equip higher than online retailers I expected better service.    Yes, their liquids are top notch and have friendly staff. But if I wanted the run around, I could of shopped online and at least saved myself 40 bucks. Get your liquids here but as far as mods, tanks, and batteries shop elsewhere.”
- “Found staff to be incredibly rude and disinterested in providing service. Upon walking in one employee wouldn't even get off his cell phone long enough to help me. The other came across as smug while providing no real information. I will not shop here again.”

## Tips from customers
Flew the Coop and Rootbeer are my faves! Honeydew!!!!! New flavor lemon cookie. Best customer service. Rootbeer is just like the drink If you mix Tropical Mist with Kilt Breeze it tastes just like Skittles! Try the Juicy Peach... it's... Perfect :)

- “Phenomenal experience here at Trenza Salon with Art Benavidez. I had a Groupon for highlights, a haircut, and styling with Art and I'm so glad I picked the right place.   It doesn't take long to realize that Art is a super friendly and outgoing guy who has so much passion for and pride in what he does. He truly is an artist and it's really fun watching him work. He knows his craft very well, is up to date with all sorts of crazy techniques, and has an eye for detail.  Starting with the consultation, Art takes the time to listen and understand what you are looking for. He really helped guide me through the process of figuring out exactly what I wanted and what would look best with my hair color.   Art did an amazing job with the coloring process. The color and highlights are so natural and blended so well; this isn't easy with Asian hair. Best yet, the color is low maintenance and will grow out very nicely without requiring root touch ups or frequent visits to the salon (don't got time for that). I had specifically requested low upkeep and he accomplished that and combined it with the look I wanted.    I was just as happy with the haircut.  He used a combination of techniques, some I had never seen before, to create long layers that brought out the highlights. Unlike other salon experiences where I had to point out certain areas that look weird after the haircut was complete, Art fixed everything without a word and did such a great job I had no complaints.    As far as the logistics go, it's super easy to book an appointment. Call or book one online.   From start to finish, the whole process took 3 hours, but it felt more like 30 minutes.  I am so happy with the outcome and the experience as a whole and can't recommend Art enough. Get your hair did with Art (snag a Groupon if available) and you won't be disappointed.   BONUS: not once was I harassed about buying extra services and products (I just dread this part about most salons).”
- “I went here to see Angie after getting an uneven cut elsewhere. I wasn't really sure what I wanted after the botched job from the other salon, but I gave her a vague description. Well, she really ran with it! She gave me one of the prettiest cuts/styles I've ever had. I'm definitely going back. I asked for shorter layers in the back for volume and texture but long in the front. She gave me exactly that, but made it cuter than what I was expecting. It turned out really well! I've been searching for a good hair dresser for a long time and I think I've finally found my regular! Too bad I didn't get a before and after shot. :(”
- “I just moved here this past summer and finding a competent stylist is as hard as finding a new doctor. I had tried one other shop and was not impressed, then was referred to Ruben at Trenza and decided to give him a try and I was not at all disappointed.  he was very warm and friendly, had a good sense of humor and did an absolutely great job on my hair.  I think I have found a new stylist, I hope he doesn't move. It cost a little more than I used to pay back home, but was worth it.”

- “Street is an excellent build-your-own burrito/taco/etc bar that also serves a wide variety of alcoholic beverages, all great complements to their food options. Its already been said, but Street reminds me of the perfect Chipotle-style restaurant I always envision, but have never been able find.. until now.   Street shines not only because of the fresh quality of the food, but also because the food is legitimately Sonoran-style Mexican. Refried beans, spanish fried rice, street corn, al pastor, and queso fresco, all ingredients I've longed for in burrito-babies and bowls of yesteryear.   The price is literally no different than Chipotle (actually cheaper depending on your choice), yet the food feels real, it feels like Tucson. $7 will get you any burrito with your choice of meat, beans, and rice along with accompanying garnishes.  Some of their drinks may be a little steep, but in my experience $7 for a good Michelada is not unheard of. The margaritas are excellent, and who doesn't like a good variety of beer with their tacos. Chips and salsa are also complimentary, self-serve as a matter of fact.   Overall: If you're looking for high quality, fast/casual Mexican food in the downtown area, look no further. In my humble opinion, it's worth parking for. Don't pass up Street, you won't be disappointed.”
- “Stopped in with my mom and boyfriend on a whim. I had the street fries with asada, plus a taco with al pastor. Everything was delicious! Can't wait to come back!”
- “I made a terrible decision to come here one day.  Terrible because now all I can think of is when will I be eating their tacos again.  I want Street everyday.  I was reluctant when I walked in my first time and see that it was like a Chipotle in that you build your own taco down the line.  But as a picky eater, I was ecstatic because it meant ordering would be simpler.  Once I took a bite of their carne asada tacos, I knew I finally found MY taco place.  Since moving to Tucson 3 years ago, I've been having a surprising amount of difficulty finding a taco place that reminded me of what I ate in Chicago.  I finally found it.  I would give them a 4 stars because it's downtown and Jesus H Christ parking is a pain in the ass.  They need a more central location.  But I love them so much, I'm not going to bring their rating down.  PLEASE open a location out of the downtown area.  Or get some parking!”

- “Why do you close at 6 on Mondays?? People eat tacos at 6:30 you know. Believe it or not, some people even eat tacos at 7. Crazy huh??”
- “The only reason I am giving it 1 star is due to the attitude of the young man who didn't charge me for that one taco & came hunting me down for $2.99 because we know that will break the business!  If he was professional in advising me that HE forgot to charge me, and being that it was my first time at this establishment, you would have received a higher rating.    I always say you have one time to make a first impression, and y'all blew it!   I did truly enjoy the Watermelon/Cucumber Agua Fresca, that indeed was BOMB!  But come on my peeps, have a better attitude, and DO NOT hire family, they're the ones that screw it up for you!  ¡Nuestra jente te dan mal nombre! ¡Familia o no!  Another issue I had, is that I totally smelled, for the rest of the day, like fried Mexican food...I don't fry inside my house for this reason.  So, even though you are literally one block away from my work, I will not be stopping in again and please don't make it a habit of HUNTING down a customer FOR YOUR ERROR!!!  ¡Cagaron el palo!”
- “Cashier was trying to put a beer on my to go order and I did not get the fish taco I ordered.  They have nice setting and the establishment seems to be fairly nice, it has got tvs, a bar, a number of tables in various sizes, and a downtown street patio complete with fire heaters for cold nights.  I had the sonoran dog and received two beef tacos that I did not ask for.  The tacos has scraps of beef with cilantro and onion.  They also have the regular styled tacos with tomatoes and lettuce.  The dog was the last one sitting the bin and a bit soggy.  Compared to truck dogs, it does not compare.  The tacos were simply bits of beef with onion and cilantro, nothing impressive and nothing like what is seen in the pictures.  Perhaps, my disappointing experience was due to how the place was packed, had a line out the door by the time I left, and was somewhat loud, but that is no excuse for the terrible eating experience.  They were starting to run out of the beef and dog that I ordered when I got in at the end of a fairly short line, i would hate to think how much worst if I came in a bit later for the dinner rush.”

- “Georgia and the crew was great! I came for business and they showed my entire team 5 star treatment! I advise staying here for business and pleasure!!!!!”
- “This was the cleanest hotel I ever stayed in. Front desk was very accommodating and the bed was very comfortable. Loved the comforter and the abundance of towels. Thank you for a good night's rest!”
- “Just finished a cross country drive, NJ to AZ/Ca. Stayed here for 4 nights while establishing another residence here.   CLEAN !!   Yes this Hampton is CLEAN!   SERVICE!!  Yes this Hampton has trained their staff in service!!  Now we had just spent Sunday night at the JW Marriott, Starr Pass, with it's run down-tired, need of a reno, buildings. Rooms were dirty, walls in need of repair. (been vacationing there for the last 10 years).   So, we book for 1 night after reading some reviews at this Hampton location. The location was 20 miles from our house in Starr Pass. Yes, we passed up many hotels along the way. After the first night, it was a "no brainer" to book 3 more nights!    The evening check in was flawless.  The hotel had a "smell" of clean.  The room was clean, floors, walls, mirrors, shower, furniture, all clean!!  The following morning we were greeted by Christine, who, by her outstanding professional attitude and above the board Customer, (Celebrity) Service, we thought she had to be the Guest Services Manager.  We ask for 3 additional nights as the app would not load rates.   Within minutes we had a confirmation.  Her pleasant, caring attitude displayed a concern for your satisfaction.   We also encountered Heather, who must be in Housekeeping. She too, was most professional in our conversation with her.   We requested daily replenishment of towels, but we received in addition, a cleaned bathroom and made bed.   We tip the housekeepers. They are the ones who pick/clean up after your mess!  The next day we thought to try the AM breakfast.  All hot and well prepared.  The server was there the first morning. And when not serving, she was cleaning the tables and cleaning up lazy guests messes!  We tipped her too!   Our second morning we encountered Bobby, who must be the site Custodian/Porter, removing bags of trash from lobby receptacles.  He too, displayed a pleasant attitude about our stay.  The evening GS employees also greeted us with positive attitudes when we arrived.   Our last morning we noticed Christine, who by the way was always professionally attired,  was serving the prepared meals. Upon asking a nearby worker, not as neatly dressed, what is Christine's position.  The woman, who turned out to be the Op's Manager replied, "she works the front desk, she's great, isn't she?"  We also noticed the "pool guy" cleaning the pool each morning.   The only negative we can point out, is that the "smoking section" should be away from the front of the entrance. The breeze/wind, blows the smoke into the lobby area, rather annoying.   Though on the edge of Tucson, but next to the "outlets" there is Marana nearby, which has most of everything you'll need.”

- “"GENERAL MANAGER KENJA" one would assume that a general manager of a HOTEL, which is in the HOSPITALITY industry, would be good with their customer service. WRONG! GM KENJA of this Hampton Inn has absolute no regard for customers or providing well customer service. To a great level I am astounded on how she holds a general manager position for a Hilton hotel with such low standards of customer service. How can someone with such lack of such service, manage a hotel, or any hotel that requires you to be a LEADER in demonstrating a high regard for customer service.? Kenja does not care for your stay nor your comfort and above all for your charges. The card was authorized for 3 nights plus room and tax and what not. AFTER she cancelled ALL my pre-existing reservations. SHE WENT AHEAD AND AUTHORIZED MY CARD A SECOND TIME FOR ANOTHER WITHOUT GIVEN CONSENT!! I was asked to go talk to the manager cause I had "booked again" but I hadn't booked after nor tried after such UNPLEASANT interaction with KENJA. All-in-all I am glad I found another hotel where I am treated as a human and my business is appreciated and they are concerned unlike Kenja. This encounter was so sour and so out of place for a HOSPITALITY industry general manager to act in such manner and have such low demeanor. HILTON CAN DO WAY BETTER THAN THAT. I will next go directly to Hilton of such experience and explain exactly the trajectory of this encounter and of the circumstance behind such horrible bind. Additionally, Kenja dared to call early to my room and call me a liar. Is this the bar that Hilton has now set for their general managers? Have they gone so downhill that they don't care that the general manager is calling up to a person's room and calling them a liar? As a business owner I would be afraid to hire someone like Kenja. Why? Because someone like her with such disregard to her role is a liability to a business and opens doors for suits for harassment by operating in such way while representing the Hilton company. The last thing as a business owner that anyone would want is the carelessness and lack of attention of a general manager who now becomes a liability. A note to Hilton company....do better.”

- “Last year my son was struggling in his pre-calculus class. I contacted Varsity Tutors and within a week a tutor was assigned. Edwin was able to not just tutor but teach My son by using language and methods that were clear to understand. He passed the class and I'm convinced that Edwin was a huge reason why. Edwin was very dependable and able to adjust his schedule when needed for last minute requests. This was a very positive experience and worth the investment.”
- “This review is to speak to VARSITY TUTORS Response Time - I was having a college crisis in English Composition one night and with my back against a wall of confusion in search of clarity, I researched "tutors" and found Varsity Tutors in the search results. I spent 2 minutes filling out a Tutor Request on their website at about 9 pm on a Sunday. Varsity Tutors returned my call by 4:30 pm the next day. THAT IS QUICK. I was unable to retain their service at this time because the university that I am attending was able to secure me a free tutor from the university's writing center. In the event that I find myself with my back against an academic wall of confusion again and in need of a off-campus tutor, I am encouraged to call the Tutors that are quick to respond:  VARSITY TUTORS!”
- “Varsity Tutors is a great resource for all of your tutoring needs. We have had tutoring for both of my teens, and both have improved grades in the subject areas in which they received tutoring. We plan to use VT when it is time for SAT test prep. Great business.”

- “I was searching for a tutor for my son so I filled out a form to receive more information.  Initially I received a couple of voice mail messages and finally spoke with Drew.  He was very nice and explained process then we scheduled a follow up call.  I looked a couple other places that offered tutors and decided to go with one the was face to face not over the internet.  Once I let Drew know that I conversation took a turn he went from nice Drew to an aggressive, pushy salesman which I immediately told him at that point there was nothing he could say to make me go with his company.  I ended the phone call by telling him to have nice day.  Beware of this company no one should be treated in this manner.”

- “I have had two sentimental pieces of jewelry (turquoise and silver cuff bracelet and multi-stone sterling silver ring) commissioned and created by Shane, the owner and jeweler, and I am so elated about how they both turned out!   He turned my very basic yet specific ideas and desires about each piece into works of art that mean so much to me. I highly recommend Mac's for their customer service, quality, inventory, and artistic skills!!”
- “I was visiting friends in Phoenix a couple of weeks ago and made a day trip down to Tucson to meet other friends from Sierra Vista for lunch. Jewelry is my favorite travel souvenir since it's easily transportable and wearing it brings back memories of my adventures, so I googled places to buy silver jewelry in Tucson and Mac's came up as a recommended place. I'm so glad I stopped in after my lunch date! The store is unassuming from the street, but they have a beautiful selection of jewelry. The associate was friendly and remained available to me as I browsed, but without breathing down my neck or making me feel pressured. I ended up with a huge, fun ring as a memento of my Arizona adventure! If I'm ever in the area again, I'll make a point of returning to this shop.”
- “They repaired my bola tie while I waited!  I have a beautiful silver and turquoise bola tie that my grandmother gave to my father.  He, in turn, gave it to me.  The leather cord wore out and one of the silver tips came off.  The fine folks at Mac's Indian Jewelry replaced the cord, reattached the tips, and shined it up for me while I browsed.  Great job, Mac's!  You made my day!”

- “BUYER BE CAUTIOUS.. I am really disappointed. Macs has changed hands and is now being run by the second generation. I have been shopping at, taking visitors to shop at, and referring tourists to shop at Macs since 2002.   I was proud of a local business who stood behind their merchandise, knew the history of the craftsmanship and was willing to make things right if there was a problem.  Yesterday a friend, who received an inlaid bracelet as a going away gift,  was back in town. The stones had fallen out of her bracelet. I told her we would take it to Macs, as they stood by their work. With no receipt, even though they recognized the bracelet and agreed it was their merchandise, they refused to help in any way. This would not have happened when the original owners were still operating the store.  No more recommendatons from me and I'll find another source for my pesonal  silver and turquoise purchases.”

## Tips from customers
Wholesale/retail jewelry, pottery, rugs, kachinas, turquoise carvings, authentic gifts. Great range and service.  Authentic Indian jewelry.  The friendliest store in Tucson

Four other companies wouldn't help me because my driveway is gravel and sloped.  Not only did they get it here, they put it in my garage and might have been the most pleasant group of guys doing really tough job in 100+ heat!!! AWESOME.  I will use them in the future and praise them to anyone who will listen.”
- “Alvarado Delivery moved our furniture and belongings from a storage facility to our new home. These guys are fantastic! They were very careful with everything and a total pleasure to work with -above and beyond service and very reasonable. This is the second time I've used this company in 11 years! Hector Alvarado is the owner and he is a man of great integrity. I totally trust and highly recommend Alvarado Delivery.”
- “It is a great pleasure for me to provide this review of Alvarado Delivery Service. A few weeks before we departed from our home in Chesapeake, VA, I contacted them regarding our need for labor to unload our 26' rental truck and place the items into storage upon our arrival in Vail. The front office was courteous and professional and listened intently to my needs. We agreed upon a crew of two people and the date and time that we would meet at the storage unit in Vail. While we were still on the road driving to Arizona, I received a confirmation phone call for our scheduled unloading. They confirmed everything was still on track for the date, time and manpower. With all we had to deal with, this gave me a great feeling of confidence. Sure enough, on the date and at the time we agreed upon, I arrived at the storage unit to find Andre and Max waiting at the storage facility. They were courteous and professional. We discussed briefly our need to separate some of the items that would remain on the truck while the bulk of the items would be placed into the storage unit. With my wife acting as the "air traffic controller" as to what went where, they responded quickly and cordially to her requests. (I just sat back and let her do her "thing" because "happy wife...happy life" are words I live by). Both Andre and Max worked steadily and professionally, finishing in less time than the estimate. My wife was thrilled with the arrangement of everything in the storage unit and the fact that nothing was damaged a bit. Both Andre and Max are about the best in the business and it would be worth your while to request them if you get the chance. On a side note, they made us feel very welcome to the area. I wholeheartedly recommend Alvarado Delivery Service to anyone who needs first class movers for any job; big or small.”

- “I called and left 2 voice messages, and sent an email from their website - 5 days ago with no response.”
- “Hired over the phone on a local business's recommendation. My instructions were for them to inspect the furniture for damage before loading onto truck. The material arrived with damage to the dining table. The company denied I requested an inspection. Consequently I was left with no monetary. recourse. The most egregious part was the insults sent my way by the owner when I advised him I was withholding payment until I could sort the issue out. I subsequently paid the bill in full. The table remains damaged.  My advice. Life's too short to deal with this mentality.”

- “The owner Ken installed an A/C unit in my place of business. He suggested that I use a 3 ton unit for the square footage of my business. It was an older brick building that was poorly insulated and this is something he was aware of.       In the middle of the Tucson summer, it would not lower the temperature anywhere past the high 80s, and this was after he installed a new unit. It was literally a sweatbox.       When I complained to him he suggested a number of things like, keeping the door closed at all times, sealing the windows, and doors etc. Of course we did all that and it was to no avail, the place remained a sweatbox.       We ended up having to retain an attorney and file a complaint with the Registrar of Contractors. After a lengthy inspection, the ROC ruled in our favor.       However, what bothered me the most was during the inspection, he lied and said that I had told him that I was planning on insulating the ceiling and that is why he chose to install a smaller 3-ton unit.       I did not own the building and I was not going to redo the roof. I NEVER said to him or anyone that I was going to rebuild and insulate a ceiling/roof on a building I did not own. I was already installing an air conditioner at my expense because I refused to allow my employees and customers to have to endure a very uncomfortable environment. Additionally, it was a hair salon and I informed him we would be using hairdryers and blowdryers. He still assured me that a 3-ton unit would be more than adequate.      He should have just replaced the unit with something that was more efficient but, he tried to get out of this by [not just] backpedaling, but by blatantly lying. That is when he lost all of his integrity with me.        To stand in front of me and everyone else and lie to my face and the inspectors in hopes of getting out of his obligation to remedy the situation was beyond offensive and wrong.       Ken, you are in the customer service business, no one forced you to be, you chose to be. At that point, he should've put on his big boy pants and fixed the situation. But to intentionally misrepresent the facts was horribly dishonest.  Shame on you!”

When I came in, it was only one guy working and he was answering the phones and working on fixing three phones at the same time. He was extremely courteous and through. I came back to ask him a question about functionality and he didn't seem bothered, but reassured me that they inspect the phone after replacing the screen. Later, when I picked up my phone, he went over the warranty and chit chatted with me a little bit although I could tell he was very busy. I appreciate excellent customer service and this place has it.”

- “First time at the ( very close to my house) new location.  Early Wednesday get together with any old friend.  Not very busy, service was prompt and friendly.  Airy, light, and comfortable. Good wine selection.  We split a mixed green salad and a potato white pizza.  Very kindly split salad onto to plates, not too dressed, just right.  My friend had never had a potato pizza, and is now hooked.  By the time we left, 6:30 ish, place was filling up. A great addition to our sometimes lacking array of choices in that area.  Will def bring the spouse to try the pasta.”
- “It has been awhile since I've been here. I spent a summer trying all the pizza places I could around Tucson and this was one of the best. The top 5 are difficult to rank because they are all so good. This was definitely on the top of my list. Highly recommend pizza here.”
- “As a Los Angeles dweller, this place has all the frills of a chic LA vibe with great food. The decor, the staff, the drink menu and the food all checks out for a great experience.  We ordered quite well, enjoying something from all parts of the menu. The bread is ridiculously good; I always say you can judge a restaurant simply from the bread and this place passes the test!  The Cacio e Pepe is delicious as well! I didn't love the Caesar salad but it was a nice compliment to the meal nonetheless.  Make sure to check out this place. It's yummy, reasonably priced by LA standards, and inviting atmosphere. Well done Reilly's!”

- “What an amazing find!  A small, private, elegant gem on the outskirts of Tucson.  Sally has tastefully blended European sophistication with the colors and textures of the Old West to create a marvelous retreat for nature lovers who crave a lot more comfort, and want to enjoy privacy 10 min from shopping and restaurants. Try the massage by the pool!  My husband and I left thoroughly rejuvenated. Well worth it.”

- “My son has taken classes here on and off for the past several years. We have found all of the instructors to be very nice and good with kids. The gym is large and there is a nice variety of things to do.  My son was most recently in the Tumbling and Trampoline class and though he has displayed no special tumbling talents as to lead us to believe we will be cheering him on from the stands someday in this sport at some future Olympics, his instructor Doug worked patiently and enthusiastically with him week after week as though he had a chance ;-). The most important thing is that he always had a good time and got a nice amount of exercise out of the heat. A couple of other highlights are the gym's summer camps, which my son enjoys. He's usually a smiling, sweaty mess when I pick him up, which is great. It's too hot during the summer to get that kind of exercise outside. Also, the gym has drop in times, where you can just go in and go to town inside the gym with unstructured play. They also have something called "Parent's Night Out" which is on Saturday now I believe. You can drop your kids off for three hours and they feed them dinner and entertain them for you. When I have taken my son to these in the past and get there five minutes early to pick him up, he begs to stay the last five minutes. My only complaint would be that the lobby is sometimes overly-full, but I think they've done some recent construction to remedy this.  If you have kids, it's a must try, they'll love it!”
- “Great place for the kids to go and be with well trained and super friendly coaches. My son goes for fun and moving his bootay! Many serious gymnastic classes are performing along side his class. Busy, fills up quickly but well worth planning for upcoming sessions.  Everyone we talked to there is nice and seems to be very happy to be there working, that means a lot to me as it usually reflects in the treatment of all the kids :)”
- “This is by far one of the best gymnastics programs in Tucson! The instructors all really care about the kids and their families. We have had to make schedule adjustments a few times since starting due to changing work schedules and though they don't have to they have gone out of their way every time to accommodate us. I love that even for the little ones (3 year old class) they change the skills every week to keep them interested, motivated, & always learning new skills. Love this place!!”

- “Injured my back about 2 weeks ago and went in for cupping therapy. The PT experience at Heliyo is second to none. Becky did a fantastic job understanding the issues in a holistic manner. She asked the right questions to get down the root of things and explained a bit about the anatomy. All the staff are current/former athletes who have extensive training in PT. This is the differentiator when it comes to the perspective and guidance. The results were instant along with the recommendations for future recovery.”
- “HELIYO is absolutely amazing. As an athlete, I put a lot of strain on my body and like most, I don't take the time to recover properly. The mobilty programs and soft tissue work here are incredible. Becky is one of the specialists that I see for my aches and pains. She takes her time with me during my appointment to analyze and assess my own personal ailments. She explains her plan of attack and hits each point in my body that are affecting me that day. She even describes what she is noticing as she works on me so that I, as an athlete, am more aware of my body and muscle system. Once the session is over, she makes sure everything is feeling better and suggests a follow up when  you're ready. I love that they don't push you to sign up for another session, but encourage you to come back just to make sure you're feeling and moving better. I highly recommend coming in and giving them a try if you're feeling broken or just need some one to check your movements.”
- “Last year, after battling a horrible tennis elbow for months, I was referred to Ryan by a friend from the gym. He used to have a debilitating hip pain and Ryan had completely fixed him. I am not a huge fan of PT, but this was a totally different experience! Not only Ryan is the nicest person ever (and a kickass coach), he is go amazingly good at his job and in a month I was back to snatching and cleaning, while before even picking up a full glass of water from the nightstand was causing me pain. The fact that he is also a CrossFitter gives him an edge because he is well aware of the kind of strain our bodies undergo. He fixed my elbow and gave me some fantastic tips that really upgraded my weightlifting skills. He has kept on checking on me months after we were done with our sessions. If you have ANY issue or you just want to step up your game do yourself a favour and go to Heliyo to see Ryan!”

- “I'm the daughter, and sister, of a dentist, so naturally I am very picky about who takes care of my teeth. Bria Dental is a wonderful, professional practice. They make you feel like family while providing state of the art dental care. I highly recommend this office to anyone in search of a new, or better, dentist.”
- “Great service. Dr Chang was fantastic!! Her technician is awesome!! Very comfortable setting. Very little discomfort during the preparation of a new crown. This is our new dentist from now on.”
- “I recently transferred my dental business to Bria dental.  I had started treatment for a dental inplant at a practice in Oro Valley where I found the dentist/owner of the practice to be short sighted, not willing to listen or answer my questions. After two visits and thorough evaluations of my x-rays and consultation I am fully confident in Dr. Sarah Chang!  What three other dentists in Tucson have missed Dr. Chang has found lingering problems in my mouth.  With a referral to an endodontist for a root canal which will save toothe number 20 I was also advised to have an implant for toothe number 3.  Once Dr. Chang completes the implant on toothe number 10 I will move forward with the implant on toothe number 3. Dr. Chang has answered all my questions.  Her staff is professional from the front desk to the technicians.  Each step along the way has been clearly explained including procedures, cost of doing business, and my biggest concern...when can I return to my normal exercise routine.  As I am 71 years young, having a mouth full of text book of dental work eating and exercise are top priorities.  If I could have had a wish it would be to have known someone like Dr. Chang when I was a wee lad so that my dental hygene would have been better then.”

With a flight of assorted hot sauces, I woke up the burger to my palate. You have to ask for the sauces because they come with a warning. They can be very spicy!! The smoothies were delicious as well, I loved the vanilla. Kind of like a Horchata with minor banana flavor in smoothie form, delicious! The staff was very friendly and the place is clean. Highly recommended for those following a Plant Based Diet!”
- “It's open again! Same menu, new owners. They are being trained by the previous owners on how to make all the same items.   Just had a great veggie chili and a green goddess wrap in a collard green. Yum.”
- “One of my favorite places in Tucson. Safe and convenient pick up, great prices, and always switching it up with exciting specials. The food here is always fresh and delicious. The outdoor seating area is cozy and spaced out nicely. The family that owns this restaurant is so sweet and caring. I can't get enough of their beautiful food!

- “Sorry guys, I really feel bad when I have to give a bad review, but I'm disappointed. This place has good intentions, but we had an epic smoothie fail here.  We ordered an Aztec Warrior smoothie, maca, cacao, etc. and requested the addition of a green powder, which is a fairly reasonable request. I've added green powders or spirulina to a smoothie with success many times. Though they were happy to accommodate the request, this seemed to throw them off.  The $7 smoothie we ordered was warm, thick to the point of being undrinkable and SOUR-- probably the almond milk had gone bad?  I even tried salvaging the smoothie by adding the $3 coconut water that we purchased but in the end it was a waste of $10 and inedible.  I've made a lot of smoothies in my life and really it's not that hard guys.  If you blend it too long it gets warm.  If you don't put enough liquid in it, it will be too thick.  If you don't taste it before you serve it to the customer and you don't really quite know what you're doing, things could go terribly wrong.  These guys are still figuring it out.  Keep trying!”

Delicious!  Looking forward to trying the Pad Thai tomorrow! Delicious food and friendly people. What else can you ask for. Closed Good Friday! Awesome food, great prep, very nice fresh drinks.   Go! Great place! fresh healthy vegan and vegetarian food downtown! Get the special early - tends to sell out quickly! Be open minded, come in and be amazed! First time visiting today and I am already hooked! Fresh and yummy!! Highly recommend. I love this place! Delicious, healthy, and worth every penny. Always super delicious and friendly. I love this place! Not a vegan but the place was great Vegan or not, this place is NOT TO BE MISSED!! (Soups were unbelievably delicious!) They update their daily special on their facebook page so you can check what it is before you even come in.  Just google "urban fresh tucson" and look for @TheNewUrbanFresh facebook page. WOW this stuff is amazing. Great food. Free parking (if you stay under an hour) at the parking garage closest to Urban Fresh Awesome food. Friendly staff. Nice outdoor COVERED patio. Healthy!!! Maca Java tastes better than ice cream!!

Larry loved the sweet potato scone!! 

We also had the green goddess wrap which was very fresh. Overall a great place! Delicious wraps and smoothies!

It was a Friday night and didn't think that I would find a reputable mechanic or one that was opened on Saturday. I called and the front desk was friendly, helpful and provided great customer service. My appointment was set at 830 and they took my car in for a diagnostic check right away. I received a comprehensive quote at a good price. The owner Scott was thorough with giving options based on budget needs. They fixed my car within 2 hours and I have confidence that I received top quality auto service with integrity and honesty. I don't trust strangers or businesses that I've not been to, however it was a very comfortable and relaxed atmosphere. Thank you Scott and Jeffrey!”

- “Great hike to the top. Not for the faint of heart. Steep and difficult trail most of the way.  DO NOT miss the trail as it leaves the valley floor! It's about 1.1 miles into the trail. I missed it and continued to bushwhack up the valley. There are cairns all the way up the valley so don't be fooled. If you reach a pesticide sign, you've missed the turn.  Other than that, great hike. Once you get up pretty high the landscape changes to rock outcroppings and pine trees. It's beautiful.”
- “Amazing views! The hike will get difficult at the end but, worth the challenge. If you keep going you can get the Pima Canyon trail or Ventanna even Mt. Lemmon. Get there early to avoid the heat you will be blocked by the shade from the canyon in the am making for a pleasant hike. Take water as no place to reload.”

This review is for my stylist Niki and her assistant ... Rachel (?). I only got my hair cut yesterday. I'll get my color next week. Niki is booked out about a month, and she searched hard and magically found a color appointment for my before my trip to Los Angeles in two weeks. Now that is service.  Ok, I digress.  I love my cut. She respected my previous stylist (and friend)'s lines, and added a bit of drama in the front, just like I asked her to. There is no doubt that, after we talked, she'll do amazing things with my color, following and amending my previous stylist's formula. They both use Wella, which is great, and I'm so excited to go back to my ... roots.  Yay new stylist new town.”

She has so much attention to detail and really listens to what I think I want and then makes my hair better than I thought possible. I didn't see her for a number of years because I've moved away, but after so many bad haircuts I went back to Melissa during a visit to Tucson. Thank goodness I went to see her because my hair has never been better. Now I have to figure out how to get back to Tucson more often!!”
- “I've only been here twice and the first time was better than the second.  But my first appt was with Larry and he was great!  He did a great job on my hair and was very sociable and sincere.  The second time I went wasn't as great but I can't remember who I saw. She cut my hair straight across on the ends, which with thick curly hair, isn't the best look.  But over all, I like this place.  See Larry though, he's awesome!”

I let her know that I had not been to a salon for almost 6 years because I was tired of being unable to find someone who could cut and style my naturally curly hair. She was so understanding of my fears and frustrations. Melissa talked me through everything she was doing and why she was doing it. My hair is still long and now looks good both curly and straight! She recommended what type of products I might want to use, without trying to sell me a product. I learned how to better style my own hair and plan to start going to see her on a regular basis to continue improving the cut! I have never been so happy with my hair!! Also, I was 15 minutes late because I was working out of town and she was very compassionate!”

- “I walked in with the worst lower back pain I have ever experienced. My job requires me to wear heavy gear and carry heavy equipment. I went to see Dr Mary and just after a few weeks I was pretty much pain free. She set me up with a plan to go in twice a week, at home exercises, and which vitamins that would help support my back and muscles. I am very pleased with my progress and will continue to show up.”
- “I signed up a few months ago and I have to say best decision I ever made! They have affordable pricing and if you need extra visits it's more then reasonable priced to add those extra visits to the month. The staff is always so nice when I first started I had no idea how it worked, and over the phone she explained the whole process so easily.  They do not have appointments but if you are member it's a pretty quick process. They literally crack your problem area and send you on your way less then 10 min process. I do have to say some doctors are a little more experienced and once you start going you'll realize it too who your favorite is. Other then that it's a very clean and inviting area. Would recommend to anyone having any pain on their body.”
- “I love the Joint, and have been getting adjustments for over 3 years. It was wonderful that they opened a branch closer to my home on the Westside of Tucson.  The staff there is warm and caring, and the adjustments have been spot on. Mary does a wonderful job! I drag myself in and I leave with a skip in my step! Love this new location in Marana!”

- “Aside from the relief that comes from not having to wash diapers, and not having to stress over finding disposable diapers when supplies were low due to the pandemic, the best thing about this business is the customer service. They always communicate well and check in often, and if I need to contact them, they respond quickly to calls, texts, and emails, so it's always convenient.”
- “Lovely service! They came to the house and taught my daughter in law how to diaper several ways . The woman was very helpful and this feature is key because most young first time parents of today have no exprience with cloth diapers and are reluctant. Both my son and his wife loved having the diapers delivered and their new born never got a rash. I was so happy they had a service in the area. I gifted my niece in Orange County  CA a month of diaper service  with a different company and they did not provide a demonstration....it was a fail. After a few try's my niece couldn't be bothered!   Again this AZ company would get 10 stars for understanding that parents need the guidance to convince them cloth diapers are in fact better in all ways than disposables. Thank you for your wonderful service!”
- “Sun Sprouts is the only way to cloth diaper! The cloth diapers are are spotless and we were amazed at how we've never run out of diapers. Cloth diapering made simple and stress free!”

- “There's nobody better than Maura with dogs AND cats.  I can't clip the nails on our kitties, but they behave perfectly for her.  She's fast, thorough and the cats are not traumatized with lots of other pet activity.  4 Paws Only is set up so that the clients are somewhat separate between the waiting area, the grooming area and the holding (for pick-up) area.  This makes for low-anxiety grooming appointments.    Maura's rates are very reasonable and every trim has been perfect (never any crushed nails or cut to the quick/bleeding).  I consider the visits to 4 Paws Only a great investment in keeping my kittie-kids happy (and my furniture healthy :-)”
- “I'm so happy I found Maura. She gave my lulu a full spa day but made sure I only did what was needed (my boyfriend wanted to have her shaved but Maura agreed with me that it was not necessary) My pup is very shy/nervous and I love that she remembered that the last time I visited. Here's a pic of Miss Lulu to brighten your day”
- “The owner is extremely sweet. Our dog always looks amazing when she leaves her shop yet her pricing is very reasonable and affordable . We are new to Tucson and so thankful that we found this salon for our dog. The shop is bit a hidden (FYI ) .”

Hands down the best massage thus nurse has ever had! On that note.... ppppssssst- nurses get a discount here!  Jessi was my therapist and she is amazing!! About a weeks ago, I had an extremely sub-par massage that I feel I wasted my money on and in no way compared to this one. Thankfully- my money was well spent today and I have already booked another appointment!”
- “The spa owner pays such attention to detail and always provides a quality service and staff in a safe and clean environment. Her therapists are the  best of the best. Ken Reader is seriously THE BEST LMT I have had to date and I'm 52.  He is comprehensive, knowledgeable, efficient and exudes experience. I now have experienced the SPA "DAZE" that everyone talks about. So grateful for this haven of goodness. Bravo team!”
- “I really needed a massage, and I knew the folks at Spa Daze would get it right! I felt clean and safe the entire time, owner Jennica and her team have really done a great job. Not easy in these times. I had a 90 minute with Ken Reader and I can not say loud enough how terrific he is, perfect touch and pressure. I floated home! Best massage in Tucson. GO!

So the girl tells me that she doesn't know how I booked the deal when they took it off the website. If you are going to offer something maybe follow through with it or since it was your mistake offer something similar ?   So I see she made a comment on my review and making false statements...I was NEVER offered 10 dollars off of anything the initial lady who I spoke to on the phone said that she didn't have that offer anymore and didn't understand how I made the APPOINTMENT when u offer something on YOUR website ....”

- “My family had a great time at Rock Solid, Saturday, 5/15/21.  I am not a rock climber but I am a parent and I was very happy with the safety and cleanliness of the gym. I didn't climb but my husband and four-year-old son did. They rented harnesses and shoes.  It was our first time, we came all the way across town and it was worth it. It is nice to have something active and indoor for kids, especially with the Tucson summer heat.  Because it was our first time we filled out our waivers and Amelia gave my son and husband an introduction. My son loved her. He really paid attention to the instructions and learned how to fall correctly.  One nice feature of rock solid is everything is color coded and spaced well. This makes it easier to give instructions to smaller kids. Although I wasn't climbing, there were plenty of nice benches and lounge areas to watch from.  Overall, we enjoyed our time at Rock Solid. We purchased a gift card for a friend, and we will be back.”
- “Huge, modern, beautiful new climbing gym. Rock Solid offers a huge variety of bouldering problems, top out boulders, toddler bouldering area, auto-belay, moon/tension/kilter boards, training gym with squat cages, free weights, and cardio machines. It's clean and bright and what's different about this climbing gym is the problems are color graded starting with pink being the easiest and black being the hardest. Masks are required for employees and climbers. They haven't been open for long but are already very popular. We'll definitely be returning.”

Windows ordered, arrived in about 4 weeks, and installed in a week. All of the folks we dealt with were friendly, professional, and easy to work with.  The crew came out and did what was expected.  They took care of unforeseen events quickly and without issue.  No mess left, no sign they were even there except brand new windows!  Highly recommend Olander's for you window needs.  We will be back when it's time to replace the remaining windows in our home.”
- “Olanders did a superior job replacing the last original window (1947) in my home. Tony and his assistant were also able to repair a botched installation of 4 windows by another company. The trim made all the difference and saved me from having to replace 4 more windows.  I highly recommend them!”
- “We've had numerous glass panes replaced in our house by these guys over several years and the service has been nothing short of awesome!  No pressure sales tactics, just straight forward professional installation at a fair price.  You won't be disappointed!”

I would highly recommended them for eyeglass needs.  They fixed my frames and did it in under a few hours!  Spread the word and make sure you call them to find out what else they can do.”
- “I brought an unusual problem to All American Eyeglass Repair -- I had a pair of vintage reading glasses with broken temples (I had tried repairing them with super glue and heat-shrink tubing) plus another pair of plain glass glasses with perfect temples, both by the same manufacturer. I asked if he could swap the good temples for the broken ones so my readers could be used again. Not only did he do that, but he also polished some light scratches out of the readers. And all for an amazingly reasonable price. This guy gets a gold star! I highly recommend this business!”
- “Broke my Steve Madden glasses. I didn't think there was any standard compatible parts for designer shades that you can find at any random glasses store. So my favorite pair of glasses were on the shelf collecting dust for months and months. Decided to stop by this place after reading good reviews. I regret not coming here sooner.

Youmi is very knowledgeable and good at explaining the issue and how she can fix it. She cupped my shoulders and did hot stone on my lower back. I feel great and much looser in the shoulders. Definitely recommend.   She is legit because she told me I would not need to come back because my result did not look that bad. Most places want you to come back again and again.”
- “I have never tried cupping or had a meridian massage before but after a quick look at Youmi's experience I knew she was the one. She is extremely skilled and knowledgeable. I felt comfortable and engaged the entire time. Youmi explained ever step of the process in just the right amount of detail. I highly recommend her for any type of massage and cupping needs. Thank you for such a wonderful experience Youmi!”
- “My fiancé has seen Youmi twice now and every time is perfection. We travel the world and he has had massages and cupping from everywhere, yet nowhere measured up to Youmi. How amazing is that to look for this gem everywhere and finally finding her in Knoxville, TN. My fiancé struggles with back pain and stress, and after every trip seeing Youmi, it melts away. You know she is legit when after the first session she told us we didn't need to come back and told us where to get the stuff on amazon and doing it at home! Unlike other places which don't fix your problems and just make more so you keep coming back. Youmi genuinely wants to help people and we will keep coming back and supporting her even though his back-pain is almost non existing anymore. Thank you Youmi! Honestly, look no further guys!! This is as best as it will get!!”

- “Each year my husband and I get away from cold weather in Toledo, OH and enjoy the warmth and sun in Tucson, AZ.  This year, shortly after we arrived in Tucson, one tooth filling broke and fell out leaving a sharp edge on the tooth..  On the recommendation of a friend, I contacted the office of Dr. Joe Larsen, DMD, and was booked for an appointment a few days later.   From the office staff that took the information needed to establish me as a patient, to contacting my dental insurance plan for information, the care was seamless.  The dental assistants in Dr. Larsen's office were efficient and kind, taking care to tell me how the dentist would most likely proceed. What I expected was a shot to numb the affected area and then a drill to get out the broken filling.  Dr. Larsen told me that he would use a laser to get out the filling and that no shots were need because the procedure was  painless.  Note, I am a 76 year old woman, and dental work has not been an experience that I usually enjoy.   Dr. Larsen explained that I would feel some cold on the tooth and explained that if not all of the filling came out with the laser, he would tap the remains out with a dental tool - again, saying that there was no pain involved.  He was very professional and competent and all went amazingly well.  I would recommend Dr. Larsen if you ever need a dentist in Tucson.  He and his staff are efficient, caring and very skilled.   Gail from Toledo, OH”
- “The  address and phone# do not match....I have Joseph Larsen 9000 N. Oracle Rd. Oro Valley, AZ. 85704 (520) 297-2007. He must have moved, I want to make sure that anyone that is looking for a GREAT dentist is able to find Dr. Joseph Larsen! I had a horrible experience with another dentist in town and going to a dentist was tuff enough but after that well...anyway, I am so thankful I found Dr. Larsen and his staff! Dr. Larsen is the best dentist I have ever had! Appts. are easy to make, both him and his staff and gentle and friendly (I have had a couple different ladies clean my teeth). Dr. Larsen is very good, gentle, personable and makes you feel very comfortable! He does a great job and will take the time needed to do it right the first time! I had a small cavity filled during one of my recent visits and before I could tell him the filling didn't feel smooth he had already noticed it and was fixing it....it was so minor I was surprised he could tell! He is like a perfectionist BUT quick about it too!    I am VERY pleased with Dr. Joe and his staff, the ladies in the office are very friendly, make appts. wiith me that work around my work schedule (they make it happen), all the insurance calls/paperwork/billing is done quickly and correctly the first time, never a problem!    I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Larsen and his staff.....for someone like myself who in the past has had panic attacks going to the dentist...well, not now, I am totally comfortable here!!! I have the best dentist in Tucson!”

Whether it's stress, injury, or whatever ails you, Ma Thai is the place to go!”

I had a stiff neck and pain on all of my right side due to stress and cervical spine issues, she worked her magic and I definitely felt better after. The stretching part was the best. $70 for an hour massage and you get a bottle of Fiji water. Highly recommended.”
- “This place is high quality and one of the best massages I have had. You get too choose between some styles before getting your massage. They even offer walking on your back, which I have only had one time before in my life. Will not be going anywhere else but here. Place is professional, relaxing and massage beds are large and amazingly comfortable.”

My fears were allayed almost immediately as she is such a warm and caring individual as well as being totally professional.   She truly is an artist.  I not only wound up doing my eyebrows, but went back and had my eyeliner done shortly thereafter.     The results were remarkable and actually better than I could have imagined.  Parts of my eyebrows had thinned and disappeared over the years.  It is virtually impossible now for anyone to know the difference.  I never need to draw them in each day as I was doing and no longer worry that part would be missing as the day wore on.  Additionally, my eyeliner is pretty impressive.  I was never able to apply eyeliner well and now I don't have to do it at all!  I wake up each day and it is one less thing to think about or even consider.   She did a beautiful job.  Elaine is a rarity and Tucson is fortunate to have someone of her caliber.”
- “I have been getting my eye brows, liner and lips done with Elaine for many years. She does such a careful and natural job. I love her work, her eye for what will work for you and the natural results you get. I just had my eye brows refreshed because I found I was starting to get that pesky eye brow liner out again. I was in and out in 40 minutes and absolutely love the results. I am turning 60 in a few short days and my eye brows have no where near the volume they had when I was younger. This brings my eye brows back to life and nobody the wiser.”
- “Elaine has been the master artist in bringing the confidence, and beauty into so many lives!  I have been going to her for years for permanent make-up touch-ups in my eyeliner,brows and lips!! And, I continue with other fabulous services with Arianne and Andrea!  Life is so much better when you are cared for and see your beautiful self in the mirror each morning!  Deb D.”

- “We are coming out of the shut-downs of COVID-19 and we really couldn't have done it so well without Tread Lightly! During the early phases we made to use the low volume of take-out only to clean the main floors of our establishment. It was the perfect time to do that deep clean that every business needs.   Since re-opening, Tread Lightly is helping us look our best with the higher-than-normal traffic which brings higher than normal finger smudges on windows, dirty grout, and overall a greater need for upkeep. Over the past 5 years I can honestly say:  -Tread Lightly has been there for us, honest, trustworthy, and reliable -Their integrity leaves us feeling good on the inside and sparkling clean on the outside -They support local; they shop with us and I know keeping things local is important to them -We have NEVER considered switching to another service as they NEVER underperform -They are so accommodating to our needs, even buying equipment specific to our establishment -Every, single time they go the extra mile  Without a doubt, Tread Lightly keeps our business in top shape! People leave reviews about our cleanliness. The grout isn't grungy even after daily mopping. Tread Lightly makes it look new. Our refrigerators are in top shape and running at peak performance with the routine cleaning of the coils which is vital when your business offers 700+ cold varieties of beverages. The ceiling fans, lightbulbs, bathroom vents, sidewalks, tile, windows, etc., are all expertly cleaned without affecting our normal business hours.   Tread Lightly works days and nights to accommodate our hours. They have a key and security code to our business. They are responsive to our communications, changing demands of our business, and offer competitive pricing. There is only so much our regular staff can do; they aren't cleaning experts, they simply keep up on regular daily cleaning. We need Tread Lightly for that deep clean which our customers notice, they TELL US that they notice how clean our business is. Tread Lightly gets the credit for that!”
- “Best carpet cleaning business in Tucson!  They always do an excellent job.  Professional, quick and beautiful job.  Thanks guys!”
- “Had tile floors cleaned and grout resealed. Excellent service. Staff friendly, professional and thorough. Price very reasonable. We would highly recommend.”

- “I was SO excited a few months ago when I Googled "pilates near Oro Valley" and saw Club Pilates pop up on the map near the Trader Joe's. I had been wanting to do reformer pilates, but some of the places around town are charging nearly 300.00 a MONTH. I soon learned that they would not be open for a few months, but signed up for a membership as soon as it became available - and was quite happy to find that their prices were very reasonable. After months of anticipation I have to say that it was worth that wait! I have taken five classes with them thus far and have found them to be fun, engaging, and challenging in a whole new way (without making me feel totally wiped out). The equipment is top of the line, and there are so many different pieces to work on (the reformer, mat, cables, exercise balls, Pilates ring, etc) that you never get the same work out twice. Camile is a fabulous instructor, very attentive and sensitive to the needs of each person in the class. She is SO good at what she does! You still feel like you get one on one attention even if there are ten other people in the room - she always checks in with people to see if they need more or less work so you get the work out toy want. She also makes sure people are exercising safely and that they are comfortable in the class. Again, this place is VERY reasonable compared to most Pilates (especially reformer based Pilates) places around town. Reformer pilates is more expensive than most other types of fitness classes, but the cost of the equipment, small class sizes, and extensive training of the instructors makes it worth it. Pilates will make you stand taller, and will give you killer abs and long, toned legs! So glad I joined Club Pilates.”
- “A great place to get healthy, strong ! Love this place ! All the teachers know their stuff and are well trained!”
- “My sister moved to the Tucson area last year, so I recently got the chance to go and spend some time with her out there. We both wanted to stay active during my stay, even with the 100 plus degree weather in AZ! Club Pilates happens to be up the road from her house, so we decided to check it out. I was a little apprehensive as I do have a torn disc, but Camille the instructor was absolutely amazing! This studio is a reformer Pilates studio which utilizes machines, which I love! I honestly can't say enough about the instructors and overall care that the staff seems to genuinely give. On top of that I left refreshed and invigorated each and every time I finished a class. If you live in the area, you must check out Club Pilates! They even offer a free intro class, so you really have no excuse!”

So impressed that she remembered me and what I was looking for. They have a great selection and it's in an awesome location. Thanks again, Lana!”
- “Great collection. Most of the 'top' shelf records are in great condition. Prices are fair. This isn't Goodwill so they are not 20 records for a buck, or whatever. They will play an album for you before you purchase which is a major plus. I should have bought more Reggae albums in the 70's because they are so dang expensive. The staff was covering from the adjacent store and she was fantastic and courteous!”

- “I never write reviews, but Abbey Funeral Services was so amazing I decided to talk about my experience. The Funeral Director Gary, is an incredible man and professional. My father died unexpectedly and Gary was there to walk me through all the unknowns and details. He is very honest, caring, attentive, patient, and straightforward man. He takes all the time you need to explain everything from the legality and finances, to even giving you ideas of proper ways to honor the passing of my father. I never felt pressured or obligated for anything he was very accommodating to our situation. Honestly words cannot express the incredible job and professional services we received. I felt incredibly comfortable and safe in this funeral home and with the services. I would recommend this place to any of my friends or family who have to go through a difficult time”
- “Our family has nothing but wonderful things to say about Abbey Funeral Chapel.  The gentleman that came and picked our Mother up (she died at home) was incredibly courteous of our feelings and treated our Mother with much care and dignity.  Gary was awesome!  He was very kind and made sure we knew every bit of the process.  He explained all of the costs and never once tried to "upsell" us anything.  He also reviewed the obituary we wrote, made some revisions and shared it on their website.  He even reuploaded it after we made a revision after he had posted it.  Overall, if you are in need of the services of a Funeral Chapel, this would be the one place I would turn to.”

- “Honestly, Happy Hemp Roll-On Herbal Therapy provides subtle and prolonged relief to my aching right hip. I have never used a CBD product but recently gifted a friend with Kuumba's Happy Salve. When I came across Kuumba at the Tucson Gem & Mineral Show, and with a hip sore from all the walking, I didn't hesitate to procure the Happy Hemp and give a try. Days later I use it in the morning on my always sore right hip and realize after a fair amount of activity, eg, two hours walking through the Tucson Botanical Gardens, that I have NO hip discomfort. It is lasting relief -- I applied the roll-on at 8 a.m., and it is now 5:15 p.m. I experience complete comfort in my right hip.  The saleswoman at the gem show was very informative about the products and was also very kind. This is a good product -- a great product -- and it is locally made in Tucson. Thank you Kuumba!”

We looked at my credit and started with a basic plan of things I needed to gather and have ready for when I found my house. After I found the house I came back and started the process in ernest. We went over a list of all the items that were needed and tasks to be accomplished. With constant communication, we had everything to the underwriters and had the stipulations submitted and the loan was funded and closed on the exact day Rolando told me when we first started. It all happened within 30 days!!! I cannot express how blessed and grateful I am for Rolando and the Guild team for their help and effort to get this mission completed!! They made me feel that I was important and not just another job to do. I cannot say how much this means, and will always come back to Rolando for all my mortgage needs!!”
- “Guild Mortgage worked with me to help me buy my first home. They were patient, informative, and incredibly responsive. I truly appreciate the assistance they offered to get me into a position where I could qualify for my first home purchase, as well as their professionalism and compassion through every step of the mortgage process. I would highly recommend for any first-time homebuyer to visit Joseph Small!”
- “This is a great place if you need a mortgage. This company is very efficient. Joe Small and his team made everything so easy, they kept us up dated on everything that was going on with the loan. We couldn't have ask for better people to work with.”

- “I absolutely LOVE this place! Trish is an amazing instructor - I feel like I have improved leaps and bounds in just 10 sessions with her. She helped me achieve basically all of my dream pole tricks, including stuff I thought was WAY off in the horizon for me. She pushes you just enough out of your comfort zone to get you to do amazing things, but never too hard and always keeps safety in mind. She will also work with you on whatever your goals are. The studio itself is also really cute, and has a bunch of poles with different sizes, both spinning and static, as well as a lollipop pole/hoop that was also fun to play with. Her rates are super reasonable for private lessons, which are worth every penny. If you're on the fence about trying out the private lessons, DO IT. It's awesome to have such an individualized experience and I cannot emphasize enough how much quicker I was able to improve with her private lessons compared to when I've taken group lessons elsewhere in the past.”
- “Amazing is not enough to describe the experience! I loved my first class and have signed up for many more! She makes you feel comfortable with no experience and is very encouraging! I'm sore after my classes and can see progress in my strength after a couple of classes. That's how you know it's worth it! So glad to be team Polefiction!  It's a great experience and wish I discovered sooner. Can't wait for my next class already!”
- “There are not enough words to express how much I LOVE my weekly 1:1 pole sessions with Trish. I have been wanting to try pole for several years but came up with a million excuses not to. Having just moved to Tucson not that long ago and wanting to try something out of my comfort zone, I finally decided to go for it. I checked a lot of websites and reviews looking for someone who did private sessions at an affordable price. That's when I found Polefiction!   From my first session working with Trish, I was hooked. Trish is an incredible instructor. It takes a really gifted person to be able to be both talented in their craft and skilled at teaching those techniques to students at various levels. She pushes you just enough out of your comfort zone that you'll find yourself doing moves you didn't think possible. BUT at the same time recognizes when you've had enough, are feeling a bit frustrated and need to move on from certain tricks. I appreciate that so much.   Her studio is super cute and private. She has different pole sizes (both static and spin), a hoop, Lyrapole, aerial silks, and more. It's been really fun getting to practice and play around with those as well.  If you've been on the fence about trying pole, sign up for a session with Trish. I promise you won't be disappointed!”

- “It all started out when I went to Gadabout for my regular cut and dye... it was a disaster, my regular guy (going to not name him due to respect and he was a good stylist the other times) had completely messed up my cut and didn't listen to my any of requests. I decided to look for a place to get the dye of my wants and I found Ajia on yelp, my father called and we went in for a consultation for the color treatment and she was super helpful! We came back in the next few days and I explained in detail of what I wanted and Ajia knew EXACTLY what I wanted without me having to show a picture! She helped me out and gave me the hair I wanted and needed!  Going to be coming back here for sure!”
- “Ajia worked her magic on my hair and I love it soooo much! I kept my hair in a pixie cut for years, so once I grew it out I felt totally inept and clueless about what to do with it. I was ready to chop it all off again, but Ajia showed me how to get rid of my heavy layers and really give my waves some volume and life! I feel like a brand new woman! I'm new to Tucson and so happy I've found MY stylist! Will be going back for regular hair upkeep.”

- “Ajja's salon is not well kept, the rest room was filthy , hair from other clients was all over the floor..I had an appointment for color, I texted Ajja a week prior to my appointment, with no response, I showed up for my appt only to find a sign on the window stating the salon was closed temporarily , we all have things going on in our lives, but to not show up for an appointment, and not let the client know that  your salon is temporarily closed was very unprofessional and unacceptable behavior.I would never recommend this salon to anyone”
- “I haven't had a real haircut in almost a year so I thought it was time and based on the reviews here, I made a last minute hair cut appointment with Melissa.   Now my hair was due for a haircut because I had done so much damage from coloring and using flat irons and we decided on long layers, face framing layers and side swept bangs and cut off at least 2 inches off the length. I also mentioned not to use the thinning shears so much bc the last stylist that did went crazy with it and didn't use it at all. Mind you, I have thick hair and I thought everything was fine and when she blow dried my hair it Seemed fine,my hair is naturally poofy so I didn't expect anything special with my blowout . My hair felt much better with a lot of the split ends gone...etc...so I went home and decided to straighten it and when I showed my husband, he was really upset bc he said my hair was all uneven and he usually never notices what I have done to my hair!!!   Ehh I was Happy with most of the damage being cut off and it honestly seemed ok but the more I look at it, the more I started to dislike what I have. The hair stylist and the lady at the reception area was nice, the price was reasonable and even let me bring my son with me, but maybe my type of hair wasn't her strong suit. I'm upset even though it's just hair. Needless to say I won't be back or recommend this place based on what happened to me.   I wish I could get my money back. I'd would rather deal with my hair all crunchy and splitting then come back. Such a shame bc this location had promising reviews.”

- “I highly recommend Flooring Direct. My mom and I were shopping for flooring for her home and just happened to stop in the Speedway store. David was both knowledgeable and tremendously helpful. He gave us a quote that was on budget. He was even able to arrange remodeling of my mom's kitchen, painting and the installation of a new bathroom vanity complete with tiled backsplash. As my mom is in her 80's and I was traveling, he had people come in and pack up my mom's house. He resolved other issues created by my travel schedule including picking up the reset lights that I forgot to get. The work was started and completed on schedule, and he sent in a crew to completely clean the house for my mom's return. The floors, kitchen and bath look spectacular! And throughout, David was a gem to work with going above and beyond to resolve all issues. He proved to be a man of his word and one who truly cares about a job well done. Again, the highest of recommendations for Flooring Direct.”
- “After purchasing a house, we hired Flooring Direct to remove old carpet and install luxury vinyl planks. The project went smoothly from start to finish.  We received a few quotes and Flooring Direct was the lowest cost option, but the quality of their work and the product is fantastic. The project was able to kickoff a week early, which we really appreciated, and they finished exactly on time. Jose was the lead installer and he did thorough, great work and always showed up on time.  I'd recommend visiting their showroom and getting a quote if you have flooring needs.”
- “It was a great experience to work with Flooring Direct.  Our tile and carpet look beautiful and were installed without any problems.  This company is trustworthy and easy to work with.  Highly recommended if you want great advice on your flooring and the job done right!”

- “Nestled way back off the beaten path is this little gem of a museum. This wonderful toy train museum is a charitable, non-profit organization that is run and supported entirely by volunteers. Their website says it best: "We are dedicated to the hobby of model railroading providing the public with interactive displays and models." When you first walk in you met with a vast room of trains moving along the tracks: Models of all gauges and sizes. Tooting their whistles and puffing their smoke. Kids of all ages hovering closely as each locomotive makes its way around the room. On the walls you will find displays of historic models dating back to the early 20th century.  The gift shop has wonderful items for sale and every time you buy from them you support this wonderful organization. Walk outside and climb up into an authentic Rio Grande caboose. A docent is there to answer your questions. They even have a small railroad running  the perimeter of the building. The museum is only open on the 2nd and 4th Sundays of the month from 12:30 to 4:30. Special group tours are available by calling Ray Mason at 520-790-0337. Admission is FREE but donations are so very welcome.  So grab the kids and head on over to this museum and spend a few hours enjoying the world of trains!”
- “This museum is a TREASURE!  It is only open a few days per month.  Recently it was every other Sunday for a few hours.  There is a building full of scale model trains and the miniature settings are amazing as well.  There is a gift shop area with lots of stuff for kids, and collectors.  They have special events for different seasons.    Outdoor displays include a ride on train, a larger garden model set and a full size caboose to walk through.  Located in an industrial area near Prince and I-10 it is a TUCSON HIDDEN Treasure.  Please visit and support this museum.”
- “Amazing experience. Perfect for kids and adults alike. Beautiful displays of O and HO scales. recommend strongly!”

- “Incredible "customer service".  Danny immediately responded to my call, showed up within 24 hours, and wore a mask.  Thank you for caring. Caring - that was the impression I got from Danny: caring for people, caring for the trees and desert plants, caring for the environment.   Danny is certified arborist who answered our many questions about trees on the property, and when not 100% certain, found the answers we posed within minutes.  He also gave us direction in next steps in constructing a wall and gate on the front of the property.  I found him to be knowledgable, professional, and easy-going.  I plan to use the services of Made in the Shade Environmental as we move forward with this project.”
- “We asked Made in the Shade to return after almost a year to again shape and trim a vigorously growing pastiche tree in our front courtyard. And once again, couldn't have been happier: perfect trim, perfect cleanup, reasonable price. You can't go wrong with Dan (a certified arborist) and his crew of expert professionals!”
- “We just had Made in the Shade trim about a dozen mesquite trees and several palo verdes in our yard that hadn't been touched in over 5-8 years. Danny Crosby gave us a reasonable bid, and scheduled our huge job to start within a week or so after we accepted the bid. We couldn't be happier with the quality of the work done. Danny's team of 4-5 guys spent 4 days carefully pruning the overgrown trees, removing mistletoe, dead branches, and weight from overly long branches while still maintaining a healthy full-looking canopy that we had requested. His team also cleared the underbrush from a small wash on our property and trimmed the native mesquites there into healthy looking trees. Cleanup was superb. We highly recommend Danny and his crew!”

- “The ladies at the front desk were really polite and helpful. I did the basic spray tan at a medium level. I've only had a spray tan once and it was with someone using an airbrush. I was delighted to find out that it was done in a machine, where I had some privacy! You get your own little room where you can undress and apply lotion, etc. The price was very reasonable and I was very pleased with the results! Will be returning when I'm back in town.”
- “Great salon, great staff, great equipment and great prices! I highly recommend the Versa Spa if you choose sunless tanning :)”
- “I love this place! The tanning beds are great the people are awesome make you feel so welcomed and I just had my eyebrows done there with Lynette and she did a fabulous job I'm very picky and they was just what I wanted she was so nice definitely have her do them again! Thanks again Lynette”

- “Probably the worst spray tan i have ever had. Got it done Monday and my feet were black in the soles my palms were brown and my fingertips were all white. The spray tan was splotchy by Tuesday and Wednesday it looked awful. My daughters wedding is Saturday and now i have no time to fix it except to try to scrub it off.”

## Tips from customers
Great place for a spray tan Great place! Make sure to come here 2-3 days before an event you are getting your tan for. It will look more natural:) The 15% off YELP offers is only for a spray tan, not UV beds They give a great uofa student discount First time tanning - I did the spray tan. What a great experience! So far love it! It is clean here and the lady that owns the place is super nice! Love love love this place.  Kelsey and Josie are awesome. Helpful and so kind the best two girls a tanning spot could ask for. Never will I go anywhere else ever for tanning stuff. I'm so glad tucson finally has a good tanning spot. The red couch is very comfy while waiting to get the flawless tan.

- “I had such a wonderful experience working with Katrina at Bravo. Bra shopping has always seemed to be a nightmare for me, until now! She was so knowledgable and helped me find the perfect fit. Great customer service along with great products equals one big win for me. SO happy I finally went (was recommended by a friend)- I will most definitely encourage all of the women in my life to go to Bravo!”
- “This bra shopping experience was AMAZING, yes really amazing. I felt SO comfortable, Cage was great a sizing me and finding the perfect bra. It is very difficult to find bras for my larger girls but they did it with ease. I have always accepted uncomfortable bras because I thought that was just the way it was. I couldn't have been more wrong, I wish I had come to Bravo sooner!! I have NEVER been more comfortable in a bra. I'm so comfortable I could sleep it and that's saying something! I found two awesome bras, they fit me perfectly and they are super cute and sexy. (You big girls know what I'm talking about) I've never been happier with my bras. I WILL be back again and again. I wore the bra out and had them throw away my old bra. That's how amazing I felt! I highly recommend Bravo!!”
- “AMAZING!  I am a breast cancer survivor and it has been just shy of 3 years since I was diagnosed. Since after my treatment I have had a very difficult time find bras that 1) fit and 2) that is comfortable to wear all day and 3) gives me the natural round look that is natural for my shape.  Today I went to another store and I was not able to find the perfect fit, they referred me to Bravo Boutique!  What a wonderful find it was!  Caige was awesome!  She was honest in her opinion of fit and look and was patient while I tried on a dozen styles!  I couldn't be happier of my discovery of this wonderful boutique!  Anyone who has trouble finding that "perfect fit" needs to check them out!  Worth ever penny to have the comfort and fit and perfect look!  Thank you ladies! See you again soon!”

- “I cannot believe I bought bird feeders! Actually I was here to buy a gift and the saleswoman knew her info about birds, how to sell, maintain humor and before I knew it I was the proud owner of bird seed and holders! Now if the birds would soon discover it at my home, I would be so very, very happy! Great service here with a smile!”
- “My latest visit here during Covid-19 time. Well the birds have been to my feeders, huge success! My new issue was the quail and mourning doves mostly eating the seed with no time allowed for smaller birds. I called the store, got great advice on what feeder road buy, purchased it on line and now have the bird seed within holders. So happy to  see gila woodpecker and others eating! Picking up my purchase the next day was easy too. Masked employee put the bags in the trunk area of car....thank you as we kept safe! My other review from months ago is here too: I cannot believe I bought bird feeders! Actually I was here to buy a gift and the saleswoman knew her info about birds, how to sell, maintain humor and before I knew it I was the proud owner of bird seed and holders! Now if the birds would soon discover it at my home, I would be so very, very happy!”
- “I live in a condo near Ventana Canyon and a few weeks ago, my neighbor, who had been feeding the birds in our shared yard, moved away. All of the birds disappeared, leaving the yard feeling extremely barren and lonesome. Having no idea what to feed them or which feeders were the best for the birds in Tucson, I was delighted to discover this store. The woman who helped me showed me several options for attracting a variety of birds, without overwhelming me or trying to sell me things I didn't need. She suggested a simple set-up that requires very little maintenance on my part. Three days later, the birds are back--and then some. There are species I don't think I've ever seen before. I'm back to having my morning coffee looking out into a veritable bird sanctuary! I'm grateful this store is in business, and I will definitely be back.”

- “Love this place!, The best market you can ever got too honestly! I'm always going to go back (: the workers are awesome and sooo helpful! MUCHAS GRACIAS”
- “My family has been patrons for over 30 years. The meat is fresh, the avocados are always perfect, the chorizo is tasty, and the prices are reasonable.  I won't buy ground beef from anywhere else. They have a small produce section that always gets me out of a pinch. Highly recommend.”
- “Still amazing as ever! Super clean and sanitized for those looking for cdc guideline updates. But realistically, this place has always had the clean feeling. They take the extra time and go the extra mile to make sure their products and facility are top notch. I recently fell for their fajita meat and ask for it to be prepped in their asada mix.. well worth it! And still this place has my heart for their chorizo! Take a stroll in here, they will not disappoint. They also sell dona tortillas as well as others and bonus... coke products. I'm a sucker for you!”
